        <p class="card-text">The materials in this collection span most of Lionel Hampton's musical career and include personal papers and business records, photographs, musical compositions, audiotape master recordings (in a variety of formats), and six musical instruments, including a vibraphone.</p>
        <p class="card-text">Lionel Hampton (1908â€“2002) was a jazz vibraphonist, drummer, pianist, composer, and band leader. Hampton was born in Louisville, Kentucky on April 20, 1908. He died on August 31, 2002 in New York City. In addition to touring worldwide and playing engagements at home, Hampton developed a relationship with the University of Idaho in 1984 and the annual jazz festival became a huge success. The University of Idaho honored Hampton in 1987 by dedicating its school of music as the "Lionel Hampton School of Music." The festival continued to grow with jazz artists from around the world participating. Hampton remained active in the festival until his death in 2002.</p>
