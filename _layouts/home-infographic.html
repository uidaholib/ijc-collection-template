         Jazz journalist Leonard Geoffrey Feather was born in Hampstead, England on September 13, 1914. In the 1930s, he arranged, composed, and produced jazz sessions, and began to write about jazz for print media. After moving to New York he worked with distinguished artists including Louis Armstrong, Dizzy Gillespie, and Duke Ellington. Writing for famous jazz journals and authoring several books, he was particularly influential in promoting Bebop. He became the chief jazz critic for the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> after moving to the West Coast in 1960. His personal and professional papers were donated to the University of Idaho's International Jazz Collection after his passing in 1994.
