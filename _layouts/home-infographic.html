          Joe Williams (Joseph Goreed) was born in Cordele, Georgia on December 12, 1918. His family moved to Chicago when he was three years old. Joe began singing professionally in the late 1930s, and during World War II was a vocalist for the prominent bands of Coleman Hawkins and Lionel Hampton. After the war, Williams continued to sing with other bands, including one with Count Basie from 1954 to 1960. With Basie, Williams had his first recorded hits, including “Everyday” and “Alright, Okay, You Win.” He toured extensively in the 1960s and 1970s from Chicago to Las Vegas. Williams was well-known for his vocals in blues, jazz, and popular ballads. He recorded many songs and pieces, won many awards, and gained worldwide recognition for his singing. He later became known for his recurring role on the Cosby Show as “Grandpa Al.” Joe Williams passed away in Las Vegas on March 29, 1999.
