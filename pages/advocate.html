<h1>Human Rights Advocate</h1>
<p>Above  all Leonard Feather was a jazz lover, and he worked his entire life to offset  anything that acted to impede originality and inspiration of the art. To this  end he was a champion of equal rights. He knew that talent was not confined to  any race or gender. He &nbsp;battled others  when they refused to accept new revelations in jazz and continually chafed  against limits imposed by the music business. Not believing that jazz was only  a western phenomenon, he traveled extensively and helped organize concerts  around the world. Everywhere he went he would listen to local groups with a  knowing ear and an open mind. He worked for many years on many fronts in order  to add to the splendor of the music he loved.</p>
<p>There  were some that did not have the same attitude. Music, like all things, has  conservatives that are rigid about their preferences and beliefs and do not  want it to change. Leonard Feather was innovative, very accepting of new  sounds, and pushed the envelope in the evolution of jazz. In 1933 he sent a  letter to the editor of <em>Melody Maker</em> asking why no jazz had been recorded in waltz or &frac34; time. The editor responded  by saying &ldquo;Asking for jazz in &frac34; time is like asking for a red piece of green  chalk&rdquo;<strong><sup><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup></strong>. Unperturbed, he  continued thinking about the waltz time jazz. Suggesting the idea to Benny  Carter they promptly recorded &lsquo;Waltzing the Blues&rsquo;. The release caused quite a  stir and much controversy. Eventually Feather was proven right and the new jazz  variation was accepted, although it was almost two decades before waltz time  jazz would not be seen as peculiar. Another evolution of jazz embraced and  promoted by Leonard Feather was bebop. There had been a war of words going on  for years about what was and what was not considered to be jazz. The <em>Esquire</em> jazz polls heightened this  debate and raised the ire of the jazz traditionalists, also known as the Moldy  Figs. When some musicians began playing a different form of jazz characterized  by fast tempos and based on a harmonic structure (bebop), it was summarily  denounced by many as not being jazz at all. Leonard&rsquo;s book entitled <em>Inside Bebop</em> helped put the movement in  perspective and helped its eventual acceptance. Still the change came about  slowly. After convincing RCA to record some bebop, Feather suggested that the  name of the album should be <em>Bebop</em>.  Even after they had already agreed to distribute the music they refused to use  the name and went with <em>New 52nd  Street Jazz</em> instead. The new style was eventually accepted and Leonard made  some enemies in the process. To make sure his work would get a fair review he  had to resort to using pseudonyms, including using his friend Billy Moore&rsquo;s  name in place of his own.</p>

<p>Gender  inequality as a &nbsp;detriment to jazz  creativity was challenged by Leonard Feather. Female singers had been more or  less accepted from the beginning, as is shown by the success of Billie Holiday,  Sarah Vaughan, and Dinah Washington. However, attitudes held by producers and  often the male musicians prevented them from participating in any other way.  Feather first met Una Mae Carlisle in 1937 and was instantly impressed by her  piano skills as well as her voice. She was a devoted fan of Fats Waller and  played in his tradition. It was Una Mae who inspired Leonard to conceive of the  blindfold test. In his first article about her in <em>Melody Maker</em> he wrote, &ldquo;How would you like to submit to a blindfold  test, listen to a typical Fats Waller song, then when the bandage was removed  find that seated at the keyboard, instead of the 200 pounds of brown skinned  masculinity you expected, was a light, slim, smiling girl?&rdquo;<strong><sup><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup></strong>. Feather was determined to dispel the notion that  women lacked the physical equipment and poise to play the instruments. His  first attempt in recording an all female band called The Hip Chicks met limited  success. The later album <em>Girls in Jazz</em> went much more smoothly. &nbsp;It was an all  female recording featuring the Beryl Booker Trio, the Vivian Garry Quintet, the  International Sweethearts of Rhythm, and a band put together special for the  recording consisting of Mary Lou Williams, Mary Osborne, June Rotenberg, L&rsquo;Ana  Hyams, and Rose Gottesman. &nbsp;In 1954 he  brought many of them back to play on <em>Cats  vs. Chicks</em>. Although none of the experiments did well commercially, they  were musically sound, quality recordings that proved talent was not restricted  to a single gender.</p>
<p>The  gravest threat to the creativity and vitality of jazz and the one Leonard  Feather worked most intensely to undo was racism. He &nbsp;worked his entire adult life for equal rights  and racial equality. This feeling began during his first trip to the U.S. &nbsp;Having grown up in London he was completely  unprepared for the degree of racism and segregation he witnessed. Even as Feather and others worked  to get jazz out more into the main stream, it was a slow process to show that  blacks were a major source of talent in jazz music. With that in mind he worked  tirelessly to educate and promote jazz talent, regardless of what the artist  happened to look like. He also participated in community programs and  eventually joined the NAACP, becoming vice president of the Hollywood-Beverly  Hills chapter in 1963. </p>
