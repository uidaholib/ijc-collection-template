<h1>Biography</h1>
<p>Leonard  Geoffrey Feather (1914- 1994) was raised as part of an upper middle class  Jewish family in Hampstead, England. His father ran a chain of clothing stores  and later in life became involved in real estate. However, Leonard had no  interest in the family businesses, and instead developed an early appreciation  for music. He did not attend college, principally because of the economic  climate following the Depression. Instead his parents arranged for him to take  an extended trip to France and Germany. There he learned everything he could  about jazz and began his long career as a journalist.</p>

<p>Feather soon realized that the jazz community in Europe was minuscule compared  to what the United States had to offer. Yearning to be at creative heart of jazz, he made his first trip to the U.S. in 1935, followed by several additional visits during which he immersed himself in the musical scene. He decided to move to America shortly after the outbreak of the Second World War, and thus began a long and distinguished career profoundly impacting the world of jazz.</p>
<p>Leonard made his new home in New York  City. While visiting a friend in California in 1945, he was introduced to  Jane Leslie Larrabee. He was instantly taken with her and proposed the next  day. They were married a few weeks later and remained together for life.  Leonard and Jane had one child, Billie Jane Lee Lorraine Feather, named in part  after her godmother, Billie Holiday. The Feathers moved to Los Angeles in 1960,  and Lorraine Feather went on to become a respected singer, composer, and lyrist  in her own right. </p>
