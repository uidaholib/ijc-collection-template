<p>Al Grey joined the Navy in 1942 at the Great Lakes Naval Training Center. Before 1942, Black Americans served in the Navy only as mess attendants and stewards. Due to a manpower shortage and discrimination during World War II, however, Black Americans were recruited as musicians.</p>
<p>Some professionals became part of the three resident bands at Great Lakes; others went through basic training and were dispatched to bases across the country in bands composed of twenty-five members. These bands gained fame as "Ambassadors of Goodwill," because they helped to break down racial barriers. Al Grey was sent to Grosse Isle Naval Air Station in Grosse Point, Michigan.</p>
<p>After his time in the Navy, Al Grey worked with the orchestras of Benny Carter (1945-1946), Jimmie Lunceford (1946-1947), Lucky Millinder, Lionel Hampton (on and off between 1948 and 1953), and Dizzy Gillespie (1956-1957). Grey gained fame as a member of Count Basie's orchestra, with whom he worked on three separate occasions (1957-1961, 1964-1966, and 1971-1977). Grey led a band with Billy Mitchell in the early 1960s and another with Jimmy Forrest after leaving Basie's orchestra in 1977. </p>
