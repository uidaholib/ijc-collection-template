## About International Jazz Collections

The International Jazz Collections (IJC) was formally established at the University of Idaho in 2000, featuring papers and photographs of the legendary Lionel Hampton. 
The IJC merged with the University of Idaho Library's [Special Collections and Archives](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/) department in 2007. 
It is now the preeminent jazz archive in the Pacific Northwest, featuring the papers, photographs, audio/visual materials, and artifacts from jazz legends such as Lionel Hampton, Leonard Feather, Lee Morse, Dizzy Gillespie, and Ella Fitzgerald.
