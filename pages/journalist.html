<p>Feather is best known as a jazz journalist and  critic. He wrote throughout his life for a wide variety of publications, including <em>Downbeat</em> and <em>Esquire</em>, before moving to California and  becoming a regular jazz columnist for <em>The Los Angeles Times.</em> His column for <em>The Times</em> was syndicated to over 500 newspapers. His reports of blindfold tests, in which participants gave their opinions of music after  listening blindfolded to a performance, helped to dispel many misconceptions  related to race and gender, or even the notion that studio men were not capable of improvising.</p>
