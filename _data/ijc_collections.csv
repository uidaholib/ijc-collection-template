ijc_hampton_collection,Lionel Hampton Library Collection,"Lionel Hampton was a jazz vibraphonist, drummer, pianist, composer, and bandleader. The materials in this collection span most of his musical career. The collection includes personal papers and business records, photographs, musical compositions, audiotape master recordings (in a variety of formats), and six musical instruments, including a vibraphone.","Lionel Hampton was born in Louisville, Kentucky on April 20, 1908. He died on August 31, 2002 in New York City. He showed a talent for music at an early age and by high school, was playing drums with a jazz band organized by his employer, a newspaper called the Chicago Defender. Later, he attended classes in music theory at the University of Southern California and gained a reputation as a great drummer on the West Coast. In 1930, Louis Armstrong, when working for Les Hite’s band, asked Hampton to fill in at an engagement at Sebastian’s Cotton Club in Los Angeles. Then, while at a recording session, Hampton discovered a vibraharp in an adjoining room and began experimenting with the instrument. He would later become recognized as the “King of Vibes.”

In 1936, Benny Goodman invited him to join his newly formed quartet and this relationship lasted for four years until Hampton decided to strike out on his own, forming the Lionel Hampton Orchestra in New York City in 1940. After the demise of the big band sound in the 1960s, Hampton changed the size and structure of his band and called it ""The Inner Circle."" His professional presence in the music industry helped hit a new milestone as blacks and whites began to integrate the scene, breaking barriers that had existed before that time. In 1936, Hampton married Gladys Riddle who became his business manager, running all aspects of the enterprise until her death in 1971.

Besides touring worldwide and playing engagements at home, Hampton developed a working relationship with the University of Idaho in 1984 and the annual jazz festival became a huge success. The university honored Hampton in 1987 by dedicating its school of music as the “Lionel Hampton School of Music.” The festival continued to grow with jazz artists from around the world participating. Hampton remained active in the festival until his death in 2002.

This collection includes memorabilia that belonged to the artist circa 1987-2000.","Dizzy (John Birks) Gillespie was born in Cheraw, South Carolina in 1917. His father, a local bandleader, had him playing the piano at age four. The elder Gillespie, however, died when his son was ten, leaving John to learn music on his own. At twelve he was playing trombone; at thirteen, trumpet. A music (and sports) scholarship enabled him to attend the Laurinburg Institute, in Laurinburg, North Carolina, but he left the school in 1935. He soon joined the Frankie Fairfax Band in Philadelphia, and there picked up his nickname “Dizzy” for his on stage clowning. Through a succession of other jobs in other bands he began developing his own distinctive style of play, finally finding a place to express this style, christened “bebop,” when, with Charlie Parker, he joined the Earl Hines band in 1942. He moved on to other bands and bebop followed. Quickly accepted by some fans and musicians, and just as quickly rejected by others, bebop nonetheless helped define post-war jazz in the U.S. and in Europe. At the time of his death, in January of 1993, Dizzy was one of the most widely recognized and admired jazz musicians both within the jazz community and in wider culture.",12 items,14,/gillespie_dizzy,https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:/80444/xv21484,https://www.ijc.uidaho.edu/gillespie_dizzy/,ijc_collection,https://www.ijc.uidaho.edu/images/IJC_DGillespie_coll_01-01.jpg,https://www.ijc.uidaho.edu/images/IJC_DGillespie_coll_01-01.jpg,

As a boy Al Grey played the baritone horn at the Goodwill Boys Band of Pottstown, Pennsylvania, led by his father. Al Grey joined the Navy in 1942 at the Great Lakes Naval Training Center. Previous to 1942, African Americans served in the Navy only as mess attendants and stewards. Due to a manpower shortage and discrimination during World War II, however, African Americans were recruited as musicians. Some professionals became part of the three resident bands at Great Lakes; others went through basic training and were dispatched to bases across the country in bands composed of twenty-five members. Al Grey was sent to Grosse Isle Naval Air Station in Grosse Point, Michigan. These bands gained fame as “Ambassadors of Goodwill,” in that they helped to break down racial barriers.

Al Grey worked with the orchestras of Benny Carter (1945-1946), Jimmie Lunceford (1946-1947), Lucky Millinder, Lionel Hampton (on and off between 1948 and 1953), and Dizzy Gillespie (1956-1957). Grey gained fame as a member of Count Basie's orchestra, with whom he worked on three separate occasions (1957-1961, 1964-1966, and 1971-1977). Grey led a band with Billy Mitchell in the early 1960s and another with Jimmy Forrest after leaving Basie's orchestra in 1977.

ijc_williams_joe,Joe Williams Collection,"Joe Williams was a jazz vocalist. The collection consists mainly of arrangements, with a few other materials.","Born in Cordele, Georgia on December 12, 1918, Joe Williams (born Joseph Goreed) became a prominent jazz vocalist with a career spanning over 50 years. At the age of three Williams and his family moved to Chicago, where he spent his formative years. In his twenties Williams worked as a singer and bouncer in Chicago. In 1943, while working at the Regal Theater, the manager sent Williams to Boston to perform with Lionel Hampton Orchestra.

After performing with Lionel Hampton in Boston, Williams began touring with the group. Though he was travelling and performing with Hampton, Williams’ first recording was with another group in 1944, the Three Chocolates. After a few years, Williams left the Lionel Hampton Orchestra and eventually joined up with Count Basie. From 1954 to 1961 Williams was the male vocalist for the Count Basie Orchestra. His first recording with them was Count Basie Swings, Joe Williams Sings, in 1955. This record featured the hit single “Every Day (I Have the Blues).” Williams went on to have many hit recordings with the Count Basie Orchestra. After leaving Basie’s band, he went on tour with Harry “Sweets” Edison’s quintet with whom he recorded three albums. Throughout his career Williams sang on his own, as well as with other notable musicians, including: Coleman Hawkins, Clark Terry, Frank Hunter, Thad Jones, Benny Carter, and many more.

In 1975, Williams starred as the titular character in Cannonball Adderley’s Big Man: Legend of John Henry. Throughout the years, he gained other acting credits, including “Grandpa Al,” on The Cosby Show in the 1980s, and appeared several times on Sesame Street in the 1980s and early 1990s. He was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1983, next to Basie's.

ijc_candoli_conte,Conti Candoli Collection,"Conte Candoli was a jazz trumpeter. The papers include original music manuscripts and published sheet music either created or used by Conte Candoli during his career. They also include newspaper clippings, programs, photographs, awards, clothing, audio and video cassettes, and a Pocket Trumpet.","Secondo (Conte) Candoli was born on July 12, 1927, in Mishawaka, Indiana to Italian immigrant parents who had settled in the United States after World War I. Conte’s father, a rubber plant factory worker, also played in a band at a local Italian club. It was through his encouragement that Conte and his older brother Pete began to play music at a young age.

Upon a recommendation from Pete, Conte joined Woody Herman’s First Herd at the age of 16, filling in during his high school summer vacation. Pete was already part of the band when Conte joined. Conte then joined the band full-time after his high school graduation in 1945. The military draft cut Conte’s time with the band short and he served in the United States Army from September 1945 to November 1946. After his discharge, he joined fellow Herman band alum Chubby Jackson’s Fifth Dimensional Jazz Group, which toured Scandinavia.

Following his time with Jackson’s group, Conte worked with Stan Kenton (1948), Charlie Ventura (1949), rejoined Woody Herman (1949-1950), Charlie Barnet (1951) and Stan Kenton again (1951-1953). Conte led his own group in Chicago in 1954 before moving to California to take session jobs and join Howard Rumsey’s Lighthouse All Stars. From the late 1950’s to the early 1960’s, Conte worked regularly with vibraphone player Terry Gibbs, toured Europe with saxophonist Gerry Mulligan’s Concert Jazz Band, and worked again with Woody Herman, Shelly Manne and Stan Kenton. During his career, Conte appeared with Woody Herman at the Monterey Jazz Festival and participated in reunions with Herman in 1976 and 1986. Conte also performed as a member of Supersax from 1972 through the 1980’s and beyond, emulating the style of Dizzy Gillespie in the group’s re-creations of Charlie Parker’s music. Beginning in 1968, Conte made occasional appearances with Johnny Carson’s Tonight Show Band led by Doc Severinsen. He became a permanent Tonight Show Band member in 1972 when Carson relocated the show from New York to Burbank, California. Conte retired from the Tonight Show, along with the rest of Severinsen’s band, when Carson retired in 1992. After his Tonight Show Band retirement, Conte toured with the Doc Severinsen Band on occasion and was also in constant demand as a teacher at trumpet clinics and jazz festivals, touring extensively throughout the 1990’s.

Conte collaborated frequently with his older brother Pete, leading a band with him in Monterey in 1973 and then continuing to perform together throughout the 1980’s and 90’s. Conte and Pete were inducted into the International Jazz Hall of Fame in 1997.

Before cancer slowed his activities, Conte continued performing at clubs, playing festivals, doing session work, and recorded 18 months prior to his death, completing Candoli Live during this time. His complete discography lists some 770 separate tracks and 123 albums on which he played. Conte Candoli died on December 14, 2001, at Monterey Palms Convalescent Home in Palm Desert, California.
