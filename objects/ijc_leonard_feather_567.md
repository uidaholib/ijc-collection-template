00:00:00:00 - 00:00:09:22
Ronnie Ross:
Girl reporter has a nice feel about it. I give that three stars.


00:00:09:24 - 00:00:14:07
Leonard Feather:
Way that I like was was justifiable, and we.


00:00:14:14 - 00:00:21:05
Ronnie Ross:
Play with a lot of jazz feeling and very good. So composed a lot.


00:00:21:08 - 00:00:31:03
Leonard Feather:
But generally I don't like that kind of thing. I like the rhythm section, but I liked it.


00:00:31:05 - 00:00:36:19
Leonard Feather:
A.


00:00:36:21 - 00:00:44:08
Ronnie Ross:
that was last Glenn on Baton. I think he's one of the most original baritone players.


00:00:44:08 - 00:00:50:00
Leonard Feather:
To come out for a long time. I don't know who the trombone player was.


00:00:50:00 - 00:01:03:25
Ronnie Ross:
I liked his sound. I think it might have been ups and I didn't like the rhythm section very much. Didn't seem to give the backing it should do. It didn't seem to swing very much.


00:01:03:27 - 00:01:06:14
Leonard Feather:
The trumpet was good, I like that.


00:01:06:17 - 00:01:14:07
Ronnie Ross:
But I didn't like the arrangement was a bit stereotyped. I suppose it must be a Swedish.


00:01:14:09 - 00:01:18:07
Leonard Feather:
band that recorded it.


00:01:18:09 - 00:01:18:20
Leonard Feather:
I think I.


00:01:18:20 - 00:01:28:24
Ronnie Ross:
Give that three stars. Did you say what you thought of the person? I think he's very good.


00:01:28:26 - 00:01:36:24
Leonard Feather:
I didn't like that very much at all. It's, Sounds like the Lenny Tristano school.


00:01:36:26 - 00:01:38:28
Ronnie Ross:
I think the tenor player might have been Wall Moss.


00:01:38:28 - 00:01:44:14
Leonard Feather:
I don't know who the trombone players. Seems sort of.


00:01:44:17 - 00:01:50:18
Ronnie Ross:
Music by numbers to me. I only give it a couple of stars.


00:01:50:18 - 00:02:02:18
Leonard Feather:
With the drummer. I thought he was good with the drum. How about that? Yeah, I didn't like that very much. Yeah.


00:02:02:20 - 00:02:07:17
Leonard Feather:
You said it was. Was style. I don't know, it.


00:02:07:17 - 00:02:18:01
Ronnie Ross:
Didn't sound very comfortable. The whole thing sounded a bit. Made me feel uneasy listening to it.


00:02:18:04 - 00:02:21:08
Leonard Feather:
Yeah, well, the older.


00:02:21:10 - 00:02:21:24
Ronnie Ross:
Brother, I.


00:02:21:24 - 00:02:27:24
Leonard Feather:
Enjoyed that very much, though,


00:02:27:26 - 00:02:43:17
Ronnie Ross:
I don't know who anybody is on that train. I like all the solos, the vibraphone and tenor and trombone. I think the rhythm section is excellent. Swing.


00:02:43:19 - 00:02:48:14
Ronnie Ross:
I'd give that four stars, nearly five just for them. That's more your kind of music.


00:02:48:14 - 00:02:57:25
Leonard Feather:
Yeah. You do like it, you know?


00:02:57:28 - 00:02:58:17
Leonard Feather:
Well, I've.


00:02:58:22 - 00:02:59:27
Ronnie Ross:
Played that arrangement.


00:02:59:27 - 00:03:06:11
Leonard Feather:
In England with Johnny Dankworth, so. Oh.


00:03:06:13 - 00:03:18:27
Ronnie Ross:
I think Johnny's got the the only big band in England still playing jazz. They're all that way. No commercial. The side, policy at all.


00:03:18:29 - 00:03:22:03
Leonard Feather:
I like the tenor, so I think that's Danny Moss. So the trumpet is.


00:03:22:10 - 00:03:28:12
Ronnie Ross:
Dickie Holden. John plays very good. I think the rhythm section.


00:03:28:20 - 00:03:35:03
Leonard Feather:
Could have been a lot better, though. It sounded a bit,


00:03:35:06 - 00:03:35:24
Ronnie Ross:
lifeless.


00:03:35:25 - 00:03:42:17
Leonard Feather:
And parts. No offense, John.


00:03:42:20 - 00:03:43:25
Ronnie Ross:
I give that three stars.


00:03:43:25 - 00:03:54:13
Leonard Feather:
I think. Okay.


00:03:54:16 - 00:04:21:15
Ronnie Ross:
Okay. I like the spirit of that very much. It a nice swinging thing. That's. I think it got a bit out of hand at the end. It was a bit goes, I don't know who the baritone player the tenor playing went off like the tenor player very much. I like some of the baritone. I like the rhythm section, definitely from.


00:04:21:18 - 00:04:27:00
Ronnie Ross:
I think I give that for stuff.


00:04:27:02 - 00:04:48:13
Ronnie Ross:
Okay. Sounds a bit like Jimmy Jeffries writing to me that. I don't think I like it very much. It doesn't seem to have a lot of jazz content in. I don't think that kind of things for me.


00:04:48:15 - 00:05:10:27
Ronnie Ross:
Are you but two stars? But it was played very well. All right. Let me do the same thing with you. That it was Albert. See if I can get any further comments on what you heard over here. what you would have liked is if you didn't hear music. well, one of the highlights for me was hearing Duke's band.


00:05:11:00 - 00:05:36:06
Ronnie Ross:
Yeah. I believe it wasn't, his best performance. But when you just hear, hear about somebody, over there and you see them for the first time in the flesh, it's a bit paralyzing. Especially Duke. Well, I like the Max Roach.


00:05:36:08 - 00:05:41:08
Leonard Feather:
Group very much.


00:05:41:10 - 00:05:50:14
Ronnie Ross:
The other night, we went to hear Colin McRae. She knocked me out. That was about the best singer I've heard over here.


00:05:50:16 - 00:05:54:01
Leonard Feather:
And the other bands?


00:05:54:03 - 00:06:08:20
Ronnie Ross:
I'd like to hear Sonny Rollins, but I think we'll hear him on Thursday. Oh, no. Oh, no, oh, no. This is Sonny becoming popular in England. Oh, yes. He's very.


00:06:08:20 - 00:06:13:23
Leonard Feather:
Popular. So imagine, you know.


00:06:13:25 - 00:06:34:15
Ronnie Ross:
Well, obviously. What would you give him? Five stars if I played it. He doesn't give any five star reviews. Oh, so that's being funded by Duke Ellington. Jam a woman.
