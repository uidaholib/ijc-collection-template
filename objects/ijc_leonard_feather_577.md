# Scott Hamilton Interview [transcript]

00:00:00:00 - 00:00:20:12
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Talk quietly.


00:00:20:14 - 00:00:27:29
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
No. Not that quiet. You stand where you are. We'll do this test better.


00:00:28:01 - 00:00:58:11
Unknown Speaker:
Okay, but stand where you are. Let's do it. We'll take him.


00:00:58:14 - 00:01:05:20
Scott Hamilton:
Take into account the fact that I read Harmony and I read chord changes. Yeah, that's the problem with that. Written in concert.


00:01:05:21 - 00:01:07:17
Leonard Feather:
Yeah.


00:01:07:19 - 00:01:17:18
Scott Hamilton:
no. You know, basic chord changes for a long time, but, just never learn to read parts because I've never had much call for it.


00:01:17:25 - 00:01:18:03
Leonard Feather:
Yeah.


00:01:18:08 - 00:01:19:26
Scott Hamilton:
Wasn't really any assessment.


00:01:19:29 - 00:01:20:25
Leonard Feather:
Yeah.


00:01:20:27 - 00:01:23:28
Scott Hamilton:
And if I've got enough time, I can usually memorize a thing.


00:01:24:01 - 00:01:24:14
Leonard Feather:
Oh, yeah?


00:01:24:18 - 00:01:27:19
Scott Hamilton:
Yeah. Just go over it a lot of times and get it into my head.


00:01:27:20 - 00:01:32:00
Leonard Feather:
Well, that album that you made with Flip Phillips, obviously flip did write some charts for it.


00:01:32:07 - 00:01:46:24
Scott Hamilton:
Yeah, those were all done. I didn't look at any music for those things. jus you wrote them out for the rest of the guys and, but you flip likes to rehearse so much. Yeah, I it was absolutely no problem memorizing that stuff.


00:01:46:24 - 00:01:47:05
Leonard Feather:
Yeah.


00:01:47:11 - 00:02:05:06
Scott Hamilton:
Yeah. We'll go over things I think because he does and he doesn't work all the time. I think that he practices a couple hours a day. Yes. So he's he's always game for sitting around playing the play for four hours in the room. Yeah. If you don't if you don't tell him it's time for dinner.


00:02:05:14 - 00:02:09:12
Leonard Feather:
Yeah, that's a nice alibi. I got it right. Thanks. You seem to see it.


00:02:09:15 - 00:02:11:16
Scott Hamilton:
Yeah, yeah, there's an extra tune on that.


00:02:11:16 - 00:02:12:14
Leonard Feather:
Actually, I really.


00:02:12:20 - 00:02:15:16
Scott Hamilton:
Started doing that.


00:02:15:18 - 00:02:20:09
Leonard Feather:
is that on? Yeah.


00:02:20:11 - 00:02:28:12
Leonard Feather:
did you see my review at the time? Yeah, I liked it because I was. Do you think those comparisons are justified, or do you resent them?


00:02:28:14 - 00:02:34:12
Scott Hamilton:
I don't ever resent being compared to people I like. I know, you know, I've never been compared to people that I didn't like it like.


00:02:34:12 - 00:02:36:20
Leonard Feather:
Yeah. That's good. Right?


00:02:36:22 - 00:02:45:09
Scott Hamilton:
You know. Yeah. Naturally there's. And the other thing is I don't I don't fault people for hearing somebody else and then me because you know, it's there.


00:02:45:11 - 00:02:46:10
Leonard Feather:
You know.


00:02:46:13 - 00:02:54:17
Scott Hamilton:
Usually after a while I sound like I know different people so that it it's pretty hard for anybody to tell me to one particular person.


00:02:54:17 - 00:02:57:25
Leonard Feather:
Yeah, yeah. You and flip sound quite lucky that album, don't you think?


00:02:57:25 - 00:03:27:11
Scott Hamilton:
We've always had a lot in common. I think, partly because I learn quite a bit from flip directly, and also because we both like a lot of the same people. Yeah, and flip certainly comes out of a lot of different players. Each right that I know that's that's one of the reasons why I think, you know says he enjoys playing together with me, is because it's just kind of a the blend is kind of natural.


00:03:27:12 - 00:03:30:03
Scott Hamilton:
It just. Yeah. Two sounds go together.


00:03:30:06 - 00:03:54:04
Leonard Feather:
You. When you, when you first came up, everybody thought you were an anachronism, you know, and it was, you know, kind of a in the same way that they did with with Wynton. you know, on a different level because, nobody or very few people your age. What were you, 21 when you first came to New York?


00:03:54:07 - 00:03:54:27
Scott Hamilton:
Yeah.


00:03:54:29 - 00:04:00:18
Leonard Feather:
You know, so few people were doing anything except try to sound like good. I don't know who to say.


00:04:00:18 - 00:04:05:07
Scott Hamilton:
Yeah, you know, I know what you mean. Well, that's the way it is in the night, too. I mean, I think I.


00:04:05:07 - 00:04:07:06
Leonard Feather:
Was Albert, I, you know, those were the.


00:04:07:06 - 00:04:14:27
Scott Hamilton:
Things I would have played, I think, I think I would have played basically the way I played anyway. I mean, that was what I really liked and that was really.


00:04:14:27 - 00:04:16:10
Leonard Feather:
You know.


00:04:16:12 - 00:04:29:29
Scott Hamilton:
Jazz. I had real feeling for it. But at the same time, there was a certain amount of sense to it, too. I mean, you know, it seemed like with, with everybody playing the same way, basically.


00:04:30:01 - 00:04:30:14
Leonard Feather:
Yeah.


00:04:30:21 - 00:04:33:10
Scott Hamilton:
A lot of room for somebody to play.


00:04:33:12 - 00:04:47:23
Leonard Feather:
Well, that's true, that's true. You know, there was also the feeling of, pardon me, forgetting a personal that in addition to, to sort of going back to that era in your style that you were trying to live that life, that's why you were drinking so heavily. Yeah.


00:04:47:23 - 00:05:00:23
Scott Hamilton:
Well, you know, that was kind of funny. I really, although I drank, I drank pretty heavily even before I came in, you know. But a lot of that was just pressure. I could, I wasn't really ready for what I. What I stepped.


00:05:00:23 - 00:05:02:00
Leonard Feather:
Into, you know.


00:05:02:03 - 00:05:05:11
Scott Hamilton:
And, it was scary doing what?


00:05:05:11 - 00:05:06:23
Leonard Feather:
Straighten you out.


00:05:06:26 - 00:05:14:01
Scott Hamilton:
Well, I started, you know, usually the one thing was for for years and years, I could do a gig and drink as much as I wanted and get away with it.


00:05:14:01 - 00:05:15:02
Leonard Feather:
You know?


00:05:15:05 - 00:05:21:06
Scott Hamilton:
And at a certain amount of time, you start your health, you know, starts to get bad, you know, it's like you can't do it anymore.


00:05:21:07 - 00:05:21:28
Leonard Feather:
Yeah.


00:05:22:00 - 00:05:27:27
Scott Hamilton:
And when I started losing jobs because of that, though, I didn't waste any time getting into that. That was.


00:05:27:29 - 00:05:30:03
Leonard Feather:
I would say, just quit cold turkey.


00:05:30:05 - 00:05:34:27
Scott Hamilton:
Yeah, it took me about 50 tries, you know, that it worked.


00:05:34:27 - 00:05:45:24
Leonard Feather:
But you look so well and and you look well now. It's been a long time. I mean, you look and you sound so much healthier, but I remember you suddenly look, people say, oh, Scott, look so sick. I was then, you know, it.


00:05:45:24 - 00:05:46:26
Scott Hamilton:
Wasn't much love to.


00:05:47:00 - 00:05:50:26
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
You. It's old pictures of us.


00:05:50:28 - 00:05:57:13
Leonard Feather:
Excuse me. Yeah. Anyway, once you finally did it, I don't know what were you down to? Your weight?


00:05:57:16 - 00:06:09:27
Scott Hamilton:
Oh, well, actually, I lost a lot of weight after I quit drinking. Oh, that was purposeful. you. I got when I quit drinking, I flew up to about 145. for me.


00:06:10:03 - 00:06:13:06
Leonard Feather:
Yeah, I'll tell you. 75857.


00:06:13:08 - 00:06:15:01
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Yeah.


00:06:15:04 - 00:06:34:02
Scott Hamilton:
but I got small bones, and I was very, very fat, and I didn't like it. And I lost a lot of weight, actually, I was taking pretty good care of myself when I got way down to, I got down about a hundred, 510, but I was just, Since then, I just started eating. I can't really explain.


00:06:34:04 - 00:06:34:18
Scott Hamilton:
Going to.


00:06:34:20 - 00:06:35:18
Leonard Feather:

Scott Hamilton:
Hungry.


00:06:36:22 - 00:06:37:20
Leonard Feather:
You know, that's cool.


00:06:37:20 - 00:06:39:18
Scott Hamilton:
I'm very comfortable now. And I feel strong.


00:06:39:20 - 00:06:44:18
Leonard Feather:
Yeah. You you you you. It shows in your personality and and play and everything.


00:06:44:23 - 00:06:51:02
Scott Hamilton:
Thank you for it. I mean, you know, for the last few years I've been I've been having a fairly good run, you know.


00:06:51:05 - 00:06:55:18
Leonard Feather:
Because, you know, people say, oh, he's going to be another Lester. You have another big system, you know. And it was.


00:06:55:20 - 00:07:04:22
Scott Hamilton:
Well, I think the other thing was, you know, if you're in your 20s, you know, you really don't feel like, you know, they feel like you can really get away with on this day.


00:07:04:27 - 00:07:05:10
Leonard Feather:
Yeah.


00:07:05:17 - 00:07:16:19
Scott Hamilton:
You know, as you get a little closer to 30, you become aware of the fact that you're not going to get away with, yeah, I don't want to die. You know, I really wanted to have a good,


00:07:16:24 - 00:07:18:29
Leonard Feather:
Did you smoke to a run?


00:07:19:02 - 00:07:19:20
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Yeah.


00:07:19:23 - 00:07:23:05
Leonard Feather:
Sure. Do you smoke? No. No, really, I really don't.


00:07:23:05 - 00:07:26:23
Scott Hamilton:
Everything quit. Almost every. Everything.


00:07:26:26 - 00:07:31:05
Leonard Feather:
That's great. Well, I'm happy to see you in such good shape. Yeah.


00:07:31:06 - 00:07:39:23
Scott Hamilton:
Thing that was nice out here. It's been a nice vacation. Yes. You with those two nights? The kind of waste in the middle.


00:07:39:26 - 00:07:41:05
Leonard Feather:
So I bet it was good last night.


00:07:41:05 - 00:07:41:29
Scott Hamilton:
It was great.


00:07:42:01 - 00:07:43:03

Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Oh.


00:07:51:20 - 00:07:54:09
Leonard Feather:
How many times you've been to Japan?


00:07:54:11 - 00:08:15:04
Scott Hamilton:
I don't know, I was trying to figure that out the last time we were there. it would be, 78, 79, 81, 83. 85. Twice in 86, once in 87. That makes 80.


00:08:15:08 - 00:08:17:04
Leonard Feather:
Eight. Yeah, yeah.


00:08:17:06 - 00:08:18:23
Scott Hamilton:
It's been an average of,


00:08:18:26 - 00:08:19:15
Leonard Feather:
Once a year.


00:08:19:15 - 00:08:23:23
Scott Hamilton:
Once a year, almost. And I love going over there.


00:08:23:23 - 00:08:26:21
Leonard Feather:
Yeah. Oh, and other people are so used.


00:08:26:22 - 00:08:30:07
Scott Hamilton:
You know, to be a touring musician. Oh, that's the best place in the world.


00:08:30:07 - 00:08:36:05
Leonard Feather:
You just even for me, you know, because I'm fairly well on this swing. Yeah. Well, you know, that's. I've been there twice. I had a wonderful time.


00:08:36:05 - 00:08:40:00
Scott Hamilton:
And they take care of you. I'm sure this is if you were there to perform.


00:08:40:01 - 00:08:40:29
Leonard Feather:
That's right. Yeah.


00:08:40:29 - 00:08:55:12
Scott Hamilton:
That's wonderful. No, it's, it's and it's the easiest place as far as, you know, the day to day, just the physical reality of getting from one place to another is easier than.


00:08:55:12 - 00:08:56:16
Leonard Feather:
Oh, yeah, I.


00:08:56:18 - 00:09:03:10
Scott Hamilton:
I don't know if I'd want to live there, but, but to be over there for to work.


00:09:03:12 - 00:09:03:23
Leonard Feather:
Yeah.


00:09:04:00 - 00:09:11:14
Scott Hamilton:
You couldn't do any better. And it's fun. Now we go back and, when I'm against the visiting folks and everything.


00:09:11:17 - 00:09:12:09
Leonard Feather:

00:09:12:14 - 00:09:14:12
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
yeah. Yeah, I agree with you.


00:09:14:15 - 00:09:15:04
Leonard Feather:

00:09:29:08 - 00:09:35:25
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
All right.


00:09:35:28 - 00:09:37:24
Leonard Feather:
How many times a year?


00:09:37:27 - 00:09:39:27
Scott Hamilton:
Oh, geez, I don't know.


00:09:40:00 - 00:09:40:20
Leonard Feather:
quite a few.


00:09:40:20 - 00:09:43:22
Scott Hamilton:
I try to get over to Sweden 15 times.


00:09:43:24 - 00:09:45:02
Leonard Feather:
I know.


00:09:45:04 - 00:10:00:20
Scott Hamilton:
And, that's more than anywhere else over there. That's. That's where I get most of my work in Europe. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. But, just last year, I've been doing a lot of things since I've been working with George's band. get over to places like France a little more often.


00:10:00:22 - 00:10:01:19
Leonard Feather:
Yeah.


00:10:01:22 - 00:10:02:22
Scott Hamilton:
And,


00:10:02:24 - 00:10:07:25
Leonard Feather:
You, George Wayne. Yeah. yeah. And,


00:10:07:28 - 00:10:16:26
Scott Hamilton:
England. I didn't go to England for a long time because I didn't have anybody to put me over there. But, lately, this guy, Brian parallel, he's.


00:10:16:26 - 00:10:17:29
Leonard Feather:
Been,


00:10:18:02 - 00:10:24:27
Scott Hamilton:
Bringing a lot of people over. So I went over with Ruby last summer. we had a great time.


00:10:24:29 - 00:10:28:21
Leonard Feather:
And.


00:10:28:24 - 00:10:33:26
Leonard Feather:
How many other, saxophone players have you recorded with? Let's be quite a few. I.


00:10:33:28 - 00:10:48:05
Scott Hamilton:
Yeah. well, Buddy Tate, of course. Yeah. And, I played a lot with Harold last year. I don't think we've ever really recorded together. And, except.


00:10:48:07 - 00:10:50:09
Leonard Feather:
And, maybe a live session.


00:10:50:11 - 00:11:02:28
Scott Hamilton:
Yeah, there's one I guess going to come out that we did, but it's with a lot of other players, alcohol that I've done some other.


00:11:03:01 - 00:11:18:13
Scott Hamilton:
I did, let's see if like I tell you, I haven't recorded with nearly as many, guys that I played with, you know. Yeah, they put me together with a lot of different tenor players. Yeah, I enjoyed it. You know.


00:11:18:15 - 00:11:20:04
Leonard Feather:
especially Gibsons, of course.


00:11:20:04 - 00:11:21:00
Scott Hamilton:
Yeah.


00:11:21:03 - 00:11:21:18
Leonard Feather:
You've been one of.


00:11:21:18 - 00:11:24:29
Scott Hamilton:
Those things, you know, if you if you count those things, you can get everybody into the. Yeah.


00:11:24:29 - 00:11:28:04
Leonard Feather:
That's right. Really. Because you've been a Gibbs about eight years now, maybe.


00:11:28:04 - 00:11:32:12
Scott Hamilton:
More now, the first time I went was 77, and there's only one year that I was.


00:11:32:12 - 00:11:36:19
Leonard Feather:
In there. So. Yeah. You mean at least until I.


00:11:36:21 - 00:11:46:20
Scott Hamilton:
But that's, you know, I. Yeah. I wouldn't know what to do. I mean, if I didn't go there, I'd probably feel like. Like, I'd probably lose track of time or something.


00:11:46:21 - 00:11:47:25
Leonard Feather:
Yeah, that's a while ago.


00:11:47:25 - 00:11:50:28
Scott Hamilton:
It kind of punctuates the time of year, I guess. We have.


00:11:50:28 - 00:11:52:22
Leonard Feather:
The. We're feeling,


00:11:52:24 - 00:11:53:24
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
So.


00:11:53:26 - 00:11:55:27
Leonard Feather:
We have the same thing about the Norway Festival.


00:11:56:04 - 00:12:03:24
Scott Hamilton:
You don't? Yeah. I live in Norway and I missed it this year. I did want the smaller ships. Yeah, which was fun, but not nearly as much.


00:12:03:24 - 00:12:05:14
Leonard Feather:
You know, the crowd is not as hip as it.


00:12:05:14 - 00:12:17:07
Scott Hamilton:
Yeah. It wasn't, it wasn't the same. But I think the Norway's they want to go on and that's the spectacular ship. Do you feel like. Yeah. That's a real ocean liner.


00:12:17:10 - 00:12:20:28
Leonard Feather:
Absolutely. And the, the way he puts it together. So great.


00:12:21:05 - 00:12:26:13
Scott Hamilton:
I like it. I, I've enjoyed it from the first time. The first time I went there was 84.


00:12:26:16 - 00:12:28:04
Leonard Feather:
Yeah.


00:12:28:07 - 00:12:38:23
Scott Hamilton:
Ruby, you know someone from Libya. And after that, they started let me bring in the group, and everything's been in a great. They're one of the few people that let me bring a group with you.


00:12:38:23 - 00:12:39:14
Leonard Feather:
Yeah. That's right.


00:12:39:15 - 00:12:48:01
Scott Hamilton:
Which is really a plus. Yeah, yeah. And coming out really does support different, you know, real rhythm sections that work. Yeah. Yeah yeah.


00:12:48:01 - 00:12:52:23
Leonard Feather:
That's. You had a group together quite a while I.


00:12:52:25 - 00:13:02:27
Scott Hamilton:
Yeah. especially considering that we don't really still have the opportunity to play together all the time. Yeah. All of us are doing singles.


00:13:02:29 - 00:13:03:10
Leonard Feather:
Yeah.


00:13:03:14 - 00:13:06:21
Scott Hamilton:
You know, that's just the economics of the business.


00:13:06:25 - 00:13:08:03
Leonard Feather:
Oh, sure.


00:13:08:06 - 00:13:17:22
Scott Hamilton:
But it's been, most of us have been together for at least ten years, and so.


00:13:17:24 - 00:13:20:07
Leonard Feather:
Yeah, so.


00:13:20:10 - 00:13:27:11
Scott Hamilton:
It's nice to try. I try to keep that if I can.


00:13:27:14 - 00:13:33:23
Leonard Feather:
What do you think of, some of the little things that have happened last year? What do you think of the Marsalis?


00:13:33:25 - 00:13:47:02
Scott Hamilton:
I think they played very good. Both of them. I, I don't know that any records by them, but I get to hear them on the radio and it's different jazz, but.


00:13:47:03 - 00:13:48:28
Leonard Feather:
Doing great that.


00:13:49:00 - 00:13:51:00
Scott Hamilton:
I think Branford plays, right. Yeah.


00:13:51:02 - 00:13:51:14
Leonard Feather:
Oh, yeah.


00:13:51:21 - 00:13:59:02
Scott Hamilton:
And it's there's, you know, it's fine. You know, when it's such a controversial figure isn't it, in the present.


00:13:59:09 - 00:14:03:29
Leonard Feather:
Yeah. But Branford is a more exciting musician to me.


00:14:04:02 - 00:14:05:27
Scott Hamilton:
Well, I think he sounds wonderful.


00:14:05:27 - 00:14:07:00
Leonard Feather:
I would like it.


00:14:07:03 - 00:14:15:05
Scott Hamilton:
If he plays good. I heard his last record when I was in. It's in a record store on doing World Garden Blues, and.


00:14:15:07 - 00:14:15:24
Leonard Feather:
That's right.


00:14:15:24 - 00:14:17:06
Scott Hamilton:
Yeah. So it sounded.


00:14:17:06 - 00:14:24:02
Leonard Feather:
Great. Yeah, yeah, I like that. He's also on the Ellington record plays a couple of you know the Digital Duke.


00:14:24:04 - 00:14:25:25
Scott Hamilton:
No, I don't know about that.


00:14:25:27 - 00:14:33:16
Leonard Feather:
that's another one on GRP you know, sort of and also it's partly the regular Ellington band, an immersive conductor.


00:14:33:18 - 00:14:36:08
Scott Hamilton:
You want a radio to do it?


00:14:36:10 - 00:14:38:09
Leonard Feather:
because of the Bradford Center with you?


00:14:38:11 - 00:14:43:21
Scott Hamilton:
Yeah. George had him come up and he played the soprano, and that was probably a good thing. He's played some blues.


00:14:43:23 - 00:14:50:19
Leonard Feather:
You know. Yeah, he's very adaptable. Yeah. Sort of like you. He knows enough history so he can, you know, get in any.


00:14:50:19 - 00:14:52:10
Scott Hamilton:
Area you know. You know.


00:14:52:12 - 00:14:55:13
Leonard Feather:
Yeah. Yeah.


00:14:55:15 - 00:14:59:12
Scott Hamilton:
But I think I heard that. Must have heard that record. They say yeah.


00:14:59:12 - 00:15:06:04
Leonard Feather:
Well if you got time I play 1 or 2 tracks. It's delightful. I would love and so. Well some of the charts.


00:15:06:07 - 00:15:06:24
Scott Hamilton:
Oh, yeah.


00:15:06:26 - 00:15:11:15
Leonard Feather:
Yeah. What is your best selling album? Do you know?


00:15:11:18 - 00:15:32:09
Scott Hamilton:
I think still, like, right now it's probably tennis shoes, but, it's, it's hard to say because, you know, that's been an on the market for a long time. The nice thing about Concord did I like it that they don't do too many of the record? That's true. Yeah. And a lot of them are still a lot of the early ones.


00:15:32:09 - 00:15:54:22
Scott Hamilton:
That stuff that I don't care to hear them anymore. I really, you know, changed a lot of things. But but it's nice that, you know, that a record can, you know, can stay out there for long. Yeah, too. I think it was in jazz. I think, you know, that's as far as the business end of things go. The only way you can really sell a lot of jazz records is to have them available for a long period of time.


00:15:54:22 - 00:15:56:11
Leonard Feather:
Yeah, that's right.


00:15:56:14 - 00:16:00:02
Scott Hamilton:
You have to sell them over. You know, if you think in the long run. Okay.


00:16:00:04 - 00:16:07:26
Leonard Feather:
Well, that's what I like about the company really does. And he doesn't look for an overnight big hit. But he keeps things going forever, you know.


00:16:07:28 - 00:16:11:04
Scott Hamilton:
Well we do okay. Because I got so many records that.


00:16:11:08 - 00:16:12:16
Leonard Feather:
Yeah.


00:16:12:18 - 00:16:13:28
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
That was.


00:16:14:01 - 00:16:22:23
Scott Hamilton:
Yeah. Well, that one's starting to sound, there's one that I did in Japan of, concert that we recorded live over there, and they put two record,


00:16:22:25 - 00:16:24:13
Leonard Feather:
Oh, yeah. Just.


00:16:24:15 - 00:16:28:26
Scott Hamilton:
the second set went out as a CD, so that's good. So. Yeah.


00:16:29:24 - 00:16:33:15
Scott Hamilton:
And that one I'm really proud of. So I'm glad that you.


00:16:33:19 - 00:16:35:22
Leonard Feather:
Are making news.


00:16:35:24 - 00:16:41:17
Scott Hamilton:
But so far, I guess that's probably just the first thing.


00:16:41:20 - 00:16:43:26
Leonard Feather:
But what are you going to do next? Next?


00:16:43:29 - 00:17:13:02
Scott Hamilton:
I don't know. I've been thinking about it. I want to do something. I use my, my band on the last, 4 or 5 records. Maybe even more than that. Six. And I like that. And finally, I've got some sort of a continuity. Yeah, and I won't keep on doing that. so in other words, to, to give it variety, rather than changing the rhythm section, I'd like to just change what's, what's happened.


00:17:13:05 - 00:17:19:20
Scott Hamilton:
like using a flip on. You are doing a couple of records with Ruby. And we did one with Maxine Sullivan.


00:17:19:26 - 00:17:20:21
Leonard Feather:
Yeah.


00:17:20:23 - 00:17:31:10
Scott Hamilton:
But keeping, keeping the rhythm section the same. I get, something that I can depend on because I think people see something that they don't usually see. They don't usually see a rhythm section stay the same.


00:17:31:13 - 00:17:32:29
Leonard Feather:
That's true.


00:17:33:02 - 00:17:34:01
Scott Hamilton:
Yeah.


00:17:34:03 - 00:17:37:24
Leonard Feather:
And I think either you did a video with, with Maxine Sullivan.


00:17:37:26 - 00:17:41:29
Scott Hamilton:
they put it on the commercially over there, but I don't think it's available here.


00:17:41:29 - 00:17:43:23
Leonard Feather:
Yeah, I probably will be.


00:17:43:25 - 00:17:46:15
Scott Hamilton:
Able to get it.


00:17:46:17 - 00:17:47:23
Leonard Feather:
You haven't done much composing.


00:17:47:29 - 00:17:55:00
Scott Hamilton:
You know, I'm not much of a composer. I, I like, arrange a little.


00:17:55:03 - 00:17:56:05
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
To.


00:17:56:08 - 00:18:07:19
Scott Hamilton:
put together little things that I take a bit. You know, I steal something from here. Some of them kind of put them together. Yeah, that's. That's about the extent of, Yeah. So. Right.


00:18:07:21 - 00:18:20:11
Leonard Feather:
Well, you know, improvising in a sense, is composing anyway, you know, if you were to take some things that you played and put them down on paper, there would be compositions, you would just have to maybe organize with them.


00:18:20:15 - 00:18:39:25
Scott Hamilton:
Well, that's the way I feel about it. I think that's the reason that I haven't done much composing, is that I'm spoiled. I'm used to the idea of being able to do something, and if it doesn't come out, if you don't like everything about it, and you always had the excuse of saying when I was improvising when I did this and and, yeah, you know, you can't have everything perfect.


00:18:39:25 - 00:18:45:13
Scott Hamilton:
Whereas a writing, a writing a piece of music, you kind of have to make a final decision about it.


00:18:45:13 - 00:18:46:07
Leonard Feather:
And yeah.


00:18:46:09 - 00:19:38:21
Scott Hamilton:
I'm not used to having to do that.


00:19:38:24 - 00:20:19:14
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Yeah.


00:20:19:17 - 00:22:21:25
