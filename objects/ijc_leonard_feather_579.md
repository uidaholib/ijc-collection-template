Your life is busy, busy, busy busy, busy. Your lines. Them busy busy busy busy busy.


00:01:02:19 - 00:01:04:25
Leonard Feather or Unknown Speaker:
Have two lines. Well, anyway.


00:01:05:00 - 00:01:22:15
Unknown Speaker:
I get the heading a busy signal. isn't that strange? Okay. Hold on now, if you didn't want to talk to me with the beach. For the moment, I'm waiting for tickets. Head out the door.


00:01:22:18 - 00:01:27:27
Unknown Speaker:
Hello? Yeah. Hello? Yeah. Letter? Well, yeah, I did speak to Doctor Casciano.


00:01:27:29 - 00:01:32:04
Leonard Feather or Unknown Speaker:
What is the best, best case scenario you can put on on the situation?


00:01:32:05 - 00:02:07:00
Unknown Speaker:
Okay, let me tell you the best case scenario that, that you will have a normal life span of no consequence. Really? Yeah. That's wonderful. chronic lymphocytic leukemia is generally the best sort to have. As matter of fact, let me tell you. I'm going to give you just sort of an anecdotal remark from the professors of hematology or when you encounter somebody, middle aged or beyond person with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.


00:02:07:02 - 00:02:20:24
Unknown Speaker:
It's always a debate as to whether or not to even mention its root cause, their life expectancy, or ordinarily is not altered at all. And to use the word leukemia, generally sends them into a tailspin.


00:02:20:27 - 00:02:28:10
Leonard Feather or Unknown Speaker:
Well, it was very technical about the way you put it. I think that nevertheless, you did, you know, what use would you hear? The word at all is still in the Mr..


00:02:28:11 - 00:02:28:19
Unknown Speaker:
Right.


00:02:28:24 - 00:02:32:03
Leonard Feather or Unknown Speaker:
What? You just said a little relation more than anything you said.


00:02:32:05 - 00:02:52:03
Unknown Speaker:
Yes. and that's why even though we've known about the altered blood counts, etc. for a year or so, you keep saying. But I feel good. Yeah, that's exactly right. That's exactly where I would expect you to feel. This is not like a youngster with acute leukemia.


00:02:52:05 - 00:02:54:17
Leonard Feather or Unknown Speaker:
I understand you're saying so.


00:02:54:17 - 00:03:10:07
Unknown Speaker:
You're. And that's why you're not going to get any treatment. He says he wants to do the bone marrow biopsy that you and I discussed were for forehand. Because he says with that, he can find out what's going on in the area that that the bone that the blood cells are manufactured that is namely in the bone marrow.


00:03:10:08 - 00:03:35:08
Unknown Speaker:
Right. And that will give him an idea of how extensive the process is and what the prognosis outlook for. But I can tell you that that there are people who live multiple years with this. And actually, maybe they'll have some other condition. Ultimately it's not it's not the blood that that kills them. Or they could have a heart attack, stroke, etc. like anybody else.


00:03:35:10 - 00:03:40:23
Leonard Feather or Unknown Speaker:
Yeah. It's like one of the things I wanted to ask you about was of, how's it going to take my blood pressure? It's probably not going.


00:03:40:23 - 00:03:47:11
Unknown Speaker:
To affect it one way or the other. Really. Some of other all other conditions are as if this were not present.


00:03:47:13 - 00:03:52:26
Leonard Feather or Unknown Speaker:
Were. What I'm really mean is of the psychological effect. Yesterday what he took my pressure was probably up just.


00:03:53:00 - 00:03:55:27
Unknown Speaker:
Oh yeah. Oh, sure. Oh, exactly. Oh.


00:03:55:27 - 00:03:56:13
Leonard Feather or Unknown Speaker:
That's normal.


00:03:56:16 - 00:04:00:12
Unknown Speaker:
Oh, yeah. Just, you know, seeing him and being concerned, apprehensive.


00:04:00:18 - 00:04:03:01
Leonard Feather or Unknown Speaker:
About the I think he said the diastolic was okay.


00:04:03:04 - 00:04:06:23
Unknown Speaker:
Yeah. I wouldn't worry about it. That was just an anxiety reaction.


00:04:06:24 - 00:04:10:05
Leonard Feather or Unknown Speaker:
We also said to stop the flow, thinking about doing any good.


00:04:10:08 - 00:04:16:23
Unknown Speaker:
Oh yeah. Yeah. That's right. Because it isn't that you're iron deficient. Well, you don't need the slowest thing. Yeah, right.


00:04:16:24 - 00:04:24:24
Leonard Feather or Unknown Speaker:
That's that's the one thing I want to ask him is important is, as he probably told you, I would like to arrange to take the bone marrow sample the same day. I think it was.


00:04:24:27 - 00:04:27:26
Unknown Speaker:
Yeah, well, okay. But then you would have to see a different surgeon who.


00:04:27:26 - 00:04:32:04
Leonard Feather or Unknown Speaker:
Doesn't have to go to Encino Hospital. I want to ask you to recommend me a good doctor.


00:04:32:07 - 00:04:33:19
