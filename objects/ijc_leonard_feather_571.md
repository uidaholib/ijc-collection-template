Leonard Feather:
Well, it, rather sounded like an alarm. And, some of that counts are based. couldn't,


00:01:01:16 - 00:01:22:20
Leonard Feather:
Well, I mean, when you think of land and, cows, you you automatically think of, Carl Perkins. But it didn't sound that Carl played piano. On drums. I know, Butler with the Frank Butler. yeah, I'm not sure about that.


00:01:22:22 - 00:01:23:11
Ben Webster:
You know.


00:01:23:14 - 00:01:33:04
Leonard Feather:
But he was very good. I mean, it was very good recording. The, the the balance and the solos and everything. It was, you know, like crazy.


00:01:33:07 - 00:01:35:03
Ben Webster:
You want to sound the stereo sound?


00:01:35:05 - 00:01:43:25

00:01:48:24 - 00:02:15:23
Leonard Feather:
Don't think they, he and the poor of the unit have any particular, in them? That's right. Yeah. So do you hear that? Well, I like that very much. That, spuds stars, you know, on the floor of, Well, yeah. Yeah, for me, I mean, for what they were doing and what they had to do with mom, I'd give that the most.


00:02:15:26 - 00:02:18:17
Ben Webster:
You know, to.


00:02:18:19 - 00:02:26:24

No, I didn't, Well, you started right there. roughly. I mean, you know, so I didn't get that.


00:02:26:26 - 00:02:28:21
Ben Webster:
Oh. Doesn't matter.


00:02:28:23 - 00:02:34:11
Leonard Feather:
I didn't have any. And after 21, and there comes a.


00:02:34:15 - 00:02:35:08
Ben Webster:
I think it's enough.


00:02:35:08 - 00:02:40:12
Leonard Feather:
But, decided that after me, I think even.


00:02:40:15 - 00:02:51:08

00:02:56:17 - 00:03:07:18

Okay. Or, it might be. Or maybe the phonograph sharper that I don't know.


00:03:07:21 - 00:03:09:13

Unknown
Okay.


00:04:53:28 - 00:04:57:23
Unknown

00:04:57:26 - 00:04:58:11
Leonard Feather:
this regular.


00:04:58:11 - 00:05:00:24
Ben Webster:
You recognize the piano player because his a thousand plays?


00:05:00:24 - 00:05:05:28
Leonard Feather:
No, but I mean, well, I mean,


00:05:06:01 - 00:05:28:01
Leonard Feather:
But I well, that's, that's a, terms like. Do I have to judge there? I mean, that's down that it sound all right? I would be really afraid to even, say. Oh, yes, right, I wouldn't I mean, now, who it is, it sounds like, Well, I mean, there are a lot of guys who play that style.


00:05:28:04 - 00:05:28:28
Ben Webster:
Yeah.


00:05:29:00 - 00:05:44:13
Leonard Feather:
That's right. You know, like, They did. They know, about us down in, SC now was rather reluctant about, this altogether, you know.


00:05:44:16 - 00:05:45:17
Ben Webster:
Well, that doesn't matter.


00:05:45:20 - 00:05:49:04
Leonard Feather:
But I mean, it it wasn't enough, like, to judge.


00:05:49:07 - 00:05:52:11
Ben Webster:
But I'm not trying to get you to guess who it was. I just want to know how you feel about.


00:05:52:13 - 00:05:57:23
Leonard Feather:
What I'm trying to figure out who would want to go down. I really try to go. Hey, everybody play, you know?


00:05:57:27 - 00:06:00:14
Ben Webster:
Yeah, but regardless who it was. Did you like the arrangement?


00:06:00:16 - 00:06:02:01
Leonard Feather:
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.


00:06:02:05 - 00:06:05:09
Ben Webster:
You're like one of the Latin rhythm on that too, is wonderful.


00:06:05:10 - 00:06:22:23
Leonard Feather:
Yeah, yeah. What isn't the the budget, with the, Congo, the game. Yeah. Very, very nice. Yeah. Oh.


00:06:22:25 - 00:06:26:23
Ben Webster:
well, you wouldn't play it as high as the, the record before this with you.


00:06:26:25 - 00:06:38:10
Leonard Feather:
Well, I mean, the other players I know he was playing, like, with restrictions, you know? Yeah, like all night. He didn't really get a chance to maybe extend himself. You.


00:06:38:10 - 00:06:40:28
Ben Webster:
Yeah.


00:06:41:01 - 00:06:46:01
Leonard Feather:
go. They were, like, cuffed to that, this particular rhythm.


00:06:46:02 - 00:06:49:06
Ben Webster:
Yeah. That's right. Yeah.


00:06:49:09 - 00:07:00:08
Leonard Feather:
But you think within those limitations, that was very nice. I mean, that, yeah. Very nice, I would say very nice. Yeah. For whatever. Did you a tie breaker.


00:07:00:10 - 00:07:01:24
Ben Webster:
For stars, man?


00:07:01:27 - 00:07:03:10
Leonard Feather:
Sure. Yeah.


00:07:03:13 - 00:07:06:07
Ben Webster:
I forgot to ask what you get. The other one was coming up against about.


00:07:06:10 - 00:07:10:00
Leonard Feather:
Anything being biased or.


00:07:10:02 - 00:07:15:14
Ben Webster:
Yeah. You did five. Yeah.


00:07:15:17 - 00:07:19:07
Ben Webster:
Okay. Well.


00:07:19:09 - 00:07:19:26
Leonard Feather:
Yeah.


00:07:19:28 - 00:07:23:16
Ben Webster:
We're on. I mean,


00:07:23:19 - 00:07:38:10
Leonard Feather:
Well, that's the greatest of all time and time to come. Yellow with Ray Nance. You and these guys waste. No, no.


00:07:38:13 - 00:07:42:17
Leonard Feather:
You give that 50 stars. Yeah.


00:07:42:19 - 00:07:44:15
Ben Webster:
All right. Any comment on the talent?


00:07:44:18 - 00:07:47:00
Leonard Feather:
Oh, yeah. Bone dry man.


00:07:47:07 - 00:07:54:16
Ben Webster:
After all, that's, your solo with your background is very similar to that. Remind you of you. Well,


00:07:54:18 - 00:07:57:29
Leonard Feather:
Well, I don't, I don't, I don't, I mean, and,


00:07:58:02 - 00:07:59:08
Ben Webster:
What is yours to,


00:07:59:10 - 00:08:12:15
Leonard Feather:
No, no, I wouldn't say that. No. Well, no, no, because I, I really, frankly, I wish I could, like, get on my own. I can't get over the hall, you know.


00:08:12:17 - 00:08:15:15
Ben Webster:
I get very much like you on the show, but. Well, I.


00:08:15:15 - 00:08:25:11
Leonard Feather:
Mean, now this guy and he's he's got his own thing going. Yeah, yeah. You call him something else, man.


00:08:25:13 - 00:08:26:13
Ben Webster:
Yeah.


00:08:26:15 - 00:08:31:08
Leonard Feather:
Yeah, it's boss. Yeah.


00:08:31:11 - 00:08:37:13
Ben Webster:
That's, we're a similar arrangement of the original, isn't it?


00:08:37:15 - 00:08:46:27
Leonard Feather:
Well, no, on the original, I think, last played the first court. Yeah. And,


00:08:46:29 - 00:08:51:23
Leonard Feather:
If I'm not mistaken, I think he played and c and then we went to D-flat.


00:08:51:26 - 00:08:52:25
Ben Webster:
Oh. Maybe so. Yeah.


00:08:52:26 - 00:08:55:13
Leonard Feather:
Yeah. If I'm not mistaken, that.


00:08:55:15 - 00:08:58:19
Ben Webster:
Was I moved on. The second course is just to save that row from the background.


00:08:58:22 - 00:09:04:17
Leonard Feather:
Oh, yes. Well, I mean, except from the original, I would say. Yeah. Feel.


00:09:04:20 - 00:09:05:28
Ben Webster:
How do you think it's rated among the.


00:09:05:28 - 00:09:13:10
Leonard Feather:
It looks kind of. Oh, there's 50 stars and there's a lot of Miss Fitzgerald. Yeah, yeah, yeah.


00:09:13:12 - 00:09:21:11
Ben Webster:
Okay. I don't know.


00:09:21:14 - 00:09:23:28
Leonard Feather:
What would you like to know about me?


00:09:24:01 - 00:09:26:23
Ben Webster:
Any comment?


00:09:26:25 - 00:09:36:11
Leonard Feather:
Well, The, the tenor was rather faded out, you know? so I couldn't,


00:09:36:14 - 00:09:37:25
Ben Webster:
There was too much going on.


00:09:37:28 - 00:10:12:15
Leonard Feather:
No. and the divorces were very good, but, I mean, like, the lieutenant was rather subdued, you know, and, I didn't, I really couldn't, like, distinguish. If I could tell who it was. But, I mean, very nice arrangement. And the boss is wonderful because I guess, terribly, rather restricted, you know, you know, you know, sticking, like to the laden.


00:10:12:17 - 00:10:21:16
Leonard Feather:
Very nice, though. I mean, for that particular, right, type thing, I would say very nice.


00:10:21:19 - 00:10:25:05
Ben Webster:
You don't have to be polite, you know.


00:10:25:07 - 00:10:28:13
Leonard Feather:
Well, I don't I I've never heard any bad music.


00:10:28:15 - 00:10:33:23
Ben Webster:
Well, okay, you know, I refuse to accept that.


00:10:33:26 - 00:10:49:03
Leonard Feather:
Well, no, no, I, I did not see any reason. I say that if you keep listening. let's say we're still, fooling around with the anthem, you know, estimate number. you you, you may pick up something, you know, that you can use.


00:10:49:05 - 00:10:49:22
Ben Webster:
Yeah.


00:10:49:25 - 00:10:52:26
Leonard Feather:
Yeah, yeah, that's what I think.


00:10:52:28 - 00:10:55:14
Ben Webster:
Well, how would you rate those three is good?


00:10:55:17 - 00:10:59:17
Leonard Feather:
Well. Nice.


00:10:59:20 - 00:11:01:17
Ben Webster:
Nice of you.


00:11:01:19 - 00:11:07:16
Leonard Feather:
Yeah. Different.


00:11:07:18 - 00:11:09:18
Unknown
What do you think of it?


00:11:09:20 - 00:11:13:01
Leonard Feather:
Well, it's wonderful that you and Roman.


00:11:17:26 - 00:11:19:16
Unknown
How do you think the,


00:11:19:19 - 00:11:26:13
Leonard Feather:
The background sound of the rhythm section? Well, I mean, when I listen to raw on two out of listener rhythm.


00:11:26:15 - 00:11:27:02
Ben Webster:
Yeah.


00:11:27:04 - 00:11:32:19
Leonard Feather:
Yeah. And, frankly,


00:11:32:22 - 00:11:59:03
Leonard Feather:
Incidentally, rather raw. And you. Could accomplish one thing that I could never accomplish. that piano player can, play the wrong changes. the bass player beat around change, and they play that. They they get this thing going right through that break. Right through. Yeah. I could never do that. Very. The right bass note. I'm dead. You do?


00:11:59:06 - 00:12:25:26
Leonard Feather:
Yeah. Yeah. But they get back to that Ryan too. That's, that's very, what would you call that? an not spectacular. But, they have some dreams. Yeah. No, I don't know what that is. I mean, because, it's just like buying a have, speaker. You listen for one thing, and I listen another thing when you buy a speaker, right?


00:12:26:01 - 00:12:57:07
Leonard Feather:
Yeah. So, I mean, you know, I, I just don't understand it. So that can't be a bad bass note. And they are through me, you know, but they can break through. I don't get off the rhythm. And they've gone bass player down. Just keep in rhythm which I would I would rather say that is like, bass players are playing the bass drum.


00:12:57:09 - 00:13:02:08
Leonard Feather:
you. No. Yeah. But I mean, if you listen, I'm listening to some. Now.


00:13:02:10 - 00:13:05:11
Ben Webster:
You were saying something about the two of my that was on,


00:13:05:14 - 00:13:12:03
Leonard Feather:
You know. Oh, about, barbarism. Yeah. Nothing. Absolutely on that being is very neat.


00:13:12:05 - 00:13:12:24
Ben Webster:
Well, nevertheless.


00:13:12:26 - 00:13:15:12
Leonard Feather:
When he came back. Oh, my God, I grew up near me that.


00:13:15:14 - 00:13:18:13
Ben Webster:
Well, you know, this wasn't made light of the or.


00:13:18:13 - 00:13:29:18
Leonard Feather:
I don't know when this was made, I say, but, I don't that, I detest, email question for the tune because nothing left to play anybody else. Oh. Did that you played badly. So. Period. Yeah.


00:13:29:25 - 00:13:31:20
Ben Webster:
Yeah. But nevertheless, you like this?


00:13:31:22 - 00:13:33:24
Leonard Feather:
Oh, sure. Sure.


00:13:33:26 - 00:13:35:15
Ben Webster:
I go right up.


00:13:35:17 - 00:13:45:14
Leonard Feather:
The, 50 stars. Okay. Yeah.


00:13:45:17 - 00:13:48:15
Leonard Feather:
Write it down in E-flat.


00:13:48:18 - 00:13:49:18
Ben Webster:
All right. Yeah.


00:13:49:21 - 00:14:18:09
Leonard Feather:
It was nice to in. Yeah. it was tricky to figure out who that was. I was trying to, you know, stand. But, I mean, stand. There. A little heavier than that. I think. You know. Yeah. Wait a minute. No big names. Team. It was very good. That was wonderful. I mean, I mean, that's that, that was a star.


00:14:18:11 - 00:14:20:13
Leonard Feather:
It was down to, they call it.


00:14:20:15 - 00:14:22:06
Ben Webster:
What would you call it?


00:14:22:08 - 00:14:47:05
Leonard Feather:
I don't know too much. It's I mean, they they they, they people sneak in with the West Coast and Chicago down here. Music and music swinging. Yeah. Yeah. I thought it was very, very nice. A very nice change of pace here. That's why. Nancy.


00:14:47:07 - 00:14:48:04
Ben Webster:
You like the rhythm section?


00:14:48:07 - 00:15:11:09
Leonard Feather:
Oh, wonderful. Everything. Everybody was. I mean, it was rather quick. I mean, I hear. Oh, and I don't, I don't, You notice the rhythm section. I would say, you know, when they get in the way. So the rhythm section is not getting in the way. I don't know, you you get, you swing, they fit.


00:15:11:11 - 00:15:29:27
Leonard Feather:
They don't fit. Yeah, yeah. I mean, it goes on. No, got ten. Well, how would you rate one, like, then? What would that be? But I wouldn't give it 50.


00:15:30:00 - 00:15:39:10
Ben Webster:
Yeah. No, no, no, that about 40. Yeah. Well, let's say for them you go out because I would tell them back.


00:15:39:16 - 00:15:43:11
Leonard Feather:
And or that if you want to take them.


00:15:43:13 - 00:15:46:09
Ben Webster:
Well let's just finish this one okay.


00:15:46:11 - 00:16:00:27
Leonard Feather:
I know you know it is. Well, you know, I don't know. And I didn't ask. It's good I know, I know, but I think that's, I think that's Sonny Rollins or.


00:16:00:27 - 00:16:05:18
Ben Webster:
What is it about him that's distinctive?


00:16:05:21 - 00:16:12:02
Leonard Feather:
Well, I always did dig Sonny because,
