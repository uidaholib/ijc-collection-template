Telling story about one fell down talking about three bears.


00:02:30:25 - 00:03:05:27

Okay. One day there was play read and on the lots, and they were up. And Goldilocks went to the forest and went into the door. And there she saw some porridge. She posted the bag. Milk porn. Yeah. It was too hot. She take the mom, there's porridge. It was too cold. She said the baby was porridge anyway. Yes, right.


00:03:09:29 - 00:03:10:28
Leonard Feather:
Is that the end of the story?


00:03:10:28 - 00:03:30:01
Billie Jane (a.k.a. Lorraine Feather):
No. Oh. Then. She sat on the mat on the big bear chair. It was too hard. She sat on the mother bear's chair. It was too soft. She sat on the baby bears chair and rocked and rotten rocked until it fell.


00:03:30:29 - 00:03:56:10
Billie Jane (a.k.a. Lorraine Feather):
Then she, Goldilocks felt very sleepy. Then she ran upstairs in the bed. She tried the big bear that it was too hard. Try the mother bear bear's bed. It was too far. She tried the baby bear better than it was. Yes, right. Then she fell back to sleep. Then? And then she heard the big bear coming home.


00:03:56:12 - 00:04:34:15
Billie Jane (a.k.a. Lorraine Feather):
They opened the door and saw the big mess. And who was chasing mad porridge? Mama bear said, who's increasing my porridge? And the baby bear said, who's been keeping my porridge? Anything at all? Then the mother bear said, who's been sitting on my chair? The mother said, who's been sitting on my chair? The baby bear said, who's been sitting on my chair and has broken it all up.


00:04:35:09 - 00:05:02:06
Billie Jane (a.k.a. Lorraine Feather):
Then they went upstairs and saw Goldilocks and the father. Bear said, who's been sleeping in my bed? My mother said, who has been sleeping in my bed? Then maybe this who said who'd been sleeping in my bed near his home. There the three bear pushed Goldilocks downstairs, and now Dawn told her never to come back again. That's the end.

00:20:22:07 - 00:20:40:03
Billie Jane (a.k.a. Lorraine Feather):
There's no the rabbit like carrots very much. You know, like most rabbits, like lettuce, parsley, carrots, celery tops and every kind of green and carrots. But this little bunny only liked.


00:20:40:03 - 00:20:42:14
Speaker 4
Carrots one and a half.


00:20:42:16 - 00:21:07:26
Billie Jane (a.k.a. Lorraine Feather):
Because he only liked carrots. There were many, many, many, many lettuce and carrot tops and everything. All he liked was the orange part of the carrot. Now, one night he was hunting for carrots, I think for his brother instead of his mother. Hunting year for him because his mother had a broken leg.


00:21:07:28 - 00:21:14:27
Speaker 4
one of the many new groups of young people who are interested in Dixie as my baby. From a literary and historical standpoint, some of them.


00:21:14:29 - 00:21:19:10
Billie Jane (a.k.a. Lorraine Feather):
Know he found 16 carrots and bought them back to his mother.


00:21:19:16 - 00:21:27:13
Speaker 4
Time, which I'm sure Dixie is for a lot of people who are playing it today, young and old. You don't have to be an old man to have a good time.


00:21:27:19 - 00:21:28:08
Billie Jane (a.k.a. Lorraine Feather):
She ate.


00:21:28:08 - 00:21:30:23
Speaker 4
Them. There's some little bands around that have.


00:21:30:26 - 00:21:34:07
Billie Jane (a.k.a. Lorraine Feather):
A few minutes after that. The poor little rabbit.


00:21:34:09 - 00:21:36:20
Speaker 4
A pretty dull.


00:21:36:22 - 00:22:04:05
Billie Jane (a.k.a. Lorraine Feather):
Got bad eyesight. Now this made him even more forgiving of carrots because, you know, that's very good for eyesight, isn't it, father? Yes. I just played well. The money went and found three carrots. He ate. Then he found lots more carrots and ate them. Just then he saw something moving through the bushes and a big hair came out.


00:22:04:08 - 00:22:10:25
Billie Jane (a.k.a. Lorraine Feather):
No, hello, said the hair. Did you see any fat, juicy carrots? Why, yes, I've.


00:22:10:25 - 00:22:12:07
Speaker 4
Ate.


00:22:12:09 - 00:22:27:15
Billie Jane (a.k.a. Lorraine Feather):
Said little rabbit. Those are my carrots, said the big hair. That was all that pretending that they really were. But but I found them, said the little rabbit.


00:22:27:17 - 00:22:28:25
Speaker 4
And nobody thought it.


00:22:28:28 - 00:22:43:20
Billie Jane (a.k.a. Lorraine Feather):
Oh, I know you found, said the big hair. I got a lot, most of the run because I bury my carrots, you silly rabbits takes them home. Why then.


00:22:43:22 - 00:22:44:29
Speaker 4
Began just to barely.


00:22:44:29 - 00:22:47:26
Billie Jane (a.k.a. Lorraine Feather):
Hear in case all the rabbits. You're out.


00:22:47:29 - 00:22:48:26
Speaker 4
And about that time.


00:22:48:28 - 00:22:50:06
Billie Jane (a.k.a. Lorraine Feather):
Why they get.


00:22:50:06 - 00:22:52:21
Speaker 4
More into them.


00:22:52:23 - 00:23:02:05
Billie Jane (a.k.a. Lorraine Feather):
But if you bury them when you're out of your home, you'll find them on the way. I'll come on. You dig that for me?


00:23:02:08 - 00:23:03:15
Speaker 4
Probably never played on.


00:23:03:17 - 00:23:06:29
Billie Jane (a.k.a. Lorraine Feather):
Yes. If you find any more carrots, give them all to me.


00:23:07:02 - 00:23:08:19
Speaker 4
An hour to fill at night.


00:23:08:22 - 00:23:18:22
Billie Jane (a.k.a. Lorraine Feather):
Now, all those kids over there on the pasture are your these in the field or mom? Anything you like. So the hair went away.


00:23:18:25 - 00:23:19:18
Speaker 4
I got the glasses.


00:23:19:18 - 00:23:37:22
Billie Jane (a.k.a. Lorraine Feather):
This little rabbit went into the pasture, but the big cared for him because. But then I found out there were no carrots in the pasture. Otherwise was nuts for squirrels, apples for children, and all sorts. But no carrots.


00:23:37:24 - 00:23:39:08
Speaker 4
Pop ups there.


00:23:39:11 - 00:23:55:25
Billie Jane (a.k.a. Lorraine Feather):
He was very angry, and he went back to his mother, telling her the whole story. I got his mother, his mother hopped along with him, although she could not very well. And they came to the hare.


00:23:55:28 - 00:23:57:00
Speaker 4
But,


00:23:57:02 - 00:24:02:04
Billie Jane (a.k.a. Lorraine Feather):
Louis Armstrong say your son has been taking all my carrots.


00:24:02:07 - 00:24:03:05
Speaker 4
Isn't that great?


00:24:03:07 - 00:24:35:08
Billie Jane (a.k.a. Lorraine Feather):
Said the hare. Listen, said the mother rabbit, those carrots belong to us just as well they belong to you. So I want you to give them up. There. Didn't have an answer to this. because they had taken up all the answers. Any questions? so. The hare just said. Well, they're my carrots, too, you know, you're saying I buried them there.


00:24:35:10 - 00:24:42:25
Billie Jane (a.k.a. Lorraine Feather):
I can prove it all. But then he covered his mouth and looked shame he. How could he prove it.


00:24:42:27 - 00:24:44:08
Speaker 4
For anyone I know? And that was.


00:24:44:10 - 00:24:55:02
Billie Jane (a.k.a. Lorraine Feather):

00:27:19:05 - 00:27:25:22
Billie Jane (a.k.a. Lorraine Feather):
This has been I know a CBS pro job production.


00:27:25:25 - 00:27:35:09
Leonard Feather:
Good here and say that you missed out on very few things in this thing. I play 12 records and I completely run it.


00:27:35:11 - 00:28:02:22
Speaker 4
And I have a miserable, musical memory, for people and people's names. And, even when I was I haven't worked with records now for almost three years since I've had an active jockeys here. But even when I was working with them, it would be like, well, that was the best example ever. I would put a Benny Goodman record on and I could remember every note of the cars, but I couldn't tell you the guy's name.


00:28:02:25 - 00:28:21:22
Speaker 4
I could associate the name with the record for no reason that I know. or I might not. I could sing Louis backwards, but I could remember that was Louis Armstrong. I could remember that name. Yeah, that was very embarrassing. On the record shows. I learned to bluff around it in lots of way. Yeah, but there's no need to.


00:28:21:25 - 00:28:41:23
Speaker 4
You play records in the morning now? We're just starting to. Yeah. Kelly was telling what we're able. Much more than I hope to use some good records on there. Some other good. I was afraid that they would, you know, suggest a lot of sentimental, slow. But, we've been fairly good with time and getting away with it.


00:28:41:23 - 00:28:43:29
Speaker 4
Don't copy that at the applicant.


00:28:44:01 - 00:28:55:25
Leonard Feather:
You know, as a matter of fact, one of these days I'm going to get I and see that show. I haven't seen it the first time yet. And for the obvious reason, you know, 10:00 is right. My first. I haven't been conscious.


00:28:55:27 - 00:29:23:06
Speaker 4
Somebody, caught our attention by the fact that that it's the biggest single record plugged in a single player record can get no, because we have a because I'm not writing in 31 cities, which overall is the biggest single jockey show of any type, except it's not a Jackie show. You know. Right. So actually, I may be able to do in a half assed way more, but people will come along and I was able.


00:29:23:14 - 00:29:26:00
Billie Jane (a.k.a. Lorraine Feather):
To kind of.
