00:00:00:00 - 00:00:31:09
Frank Cook, J. Otis Williams or Leonard Feather:
One. Let's move. Okay. Wow. You got it. Oh, wow. Now, what do you mean, the stars? If you go faster. Does that mean that you like it? I mean, do you think it's of. Okay, forget about the stars of the moment. Just like they were just photos. It looks nice. And I like the tennis all. And Charles Mayer.


00:00:31:09 - 00:00:41:01
Frank Cook, J. Otis Williams or Leonard Feather:
But I don't know about you. And I couldn't guess what it is because I would know. And, I think it was done. Well.


00:00:41:03 - 00:00:44:07
Frank Cook, J. Otis Williams or Leonard Feather:
And then over there, it can't go on.


00:00:44:09 - 00:00:50:10
Frank Cook, J. Otis Williams or Leonard Feather:
Yeah. There, there's correspondence.


00:00:50:13 - 00:00:58:00
Frank Cook, J. Otis Williams or Leonard Feather:
All over the mid-forties.


00:00:58:02 - 00:01:15:27
Frank Cook, J. Otis Williams or Leonard Feather:
But others are there. All right. So I guess I again, five stars. All right, well, thanks for tolerating that. Maybe we'll see. That's where I'm. That's to go.


00:01:16:00 - 00:01:22:12
Frank Cook, J. Otis Williams or Leonard Feather:
Well, it's hard to see that they might not be able to do anything better than that.


00:01:22:14 - 00:01:24:25
Frank Cook, J. Otis Williams or Leonard Feather:
You mean you have.


00:01:24:28 - 00:01:48:04
Frank Cook, J. Otis Williams or Leonard Feather:
The courage to play well? Oh, well, that's not my favorite type of music. Yeah, well, I can I can relate to that as well. That is another thing that I liked that I didn't decide to. And I wouldn't know whether to, say, I don't know. I don't really understand what you mean about really. you know what?


00:01:48:06 - 00:01:51:00
Frank Cook, J. Otis Williams or Leonard Feather:
it just means whether or not you think the good news is we are.


00:01:51:07 - 00:01:59:20
Frank Cook, J. Otis Williams or Leonard Feather:
Not very good. A very good question is, what is what is the real question?


00:01:59:22 - 00:02:21:06
Frank Cook, J. Otis Williams or Leonard Feather:
Oh, what did you find? Right, exactly. So of the two of them, you know, I consider some people over dinner for. Because you have no idea. You know, you okay? Well, what happened to the Johnny concert?


00:02:21:06 - 00:02:39:06
Frank Cook, J. Otis Williams or Leonard Feather:
He was singing along with throat, and that was good. That. No, no, no, no. And it was basically I think it was every time. Was it, buddy? Oh, okay. Hershel Evans was the solo on terrible. Should you like. And then. And then came back.


00:02:39:06 - 00:02:42:21
Frank Cook, J. Otis Williams or Leonard Feather:
Clayton is that. Yeah. I didn't hear that. So.


00:02:42:23 - 00:02:58:27
Frank Cook, J. Otis Williams or Leonard Feather:
And Eddie Durham on the guitar. if you asked if it were the part where they say, oh, yeah, I want to hear that again later, because I want to hear I want to hear it that way. I want to hear it and see why that should. Yes, it was a good part. Yeah. had I never heard it before, would I?


00:02:58:29 - 00:03:24:17
Frank Cook, J. Otis Williams or Leonard Feather:
But not because of the person. Oh. That's interesting. Yeah. you know, it's a it's that goes back to the 30s and, it's not typical of the, of the band of smooths out with the rocking later. you know, I'm tempted to give it five stars because of what it means to me. you know, when I think of Herschel, I was a kid at the time.


00:03:24:19 - 00:03:53:22
Frank Cook, J. Otis Williams or Leonard Feather:
And how revolutionary and how wonderful that was and what and how it paved the way for other great things. I cannot, if you don't like them up. today. Give these stars off on the basis of what they mean exactly today. Yeah, right. Because that was the great music. What they for me, they although they could spend the things that I liked better get up the but, the flavor of the whole thing, I'm going to give that five.


00:03:53:22 - 00:03:58:05
Frank Cook, J. Otis Williams or Leonard Feather:
Stars because I love it. The South Pacific.


00:03:58:07 - 00:04:00:19
Frank Cook, J. Otis Williams or Leonard Feather:
I did that, right.


00:04:00:22 - 00:04:04:03
Frank Cook, J. Otis Williams or Leonard Feather:
Before on his very first.


00:04:04:05 - 00:04:08:09
Frank Cook, J. Otis Williams or Leonard Feather:
muddy.


00:04:08:11 - 00:04:20:29
Frank Cook, J. Otis Williams or Leonard Feather:
Well, they don't go. On the. That's not because they're one of my assistant. in the 60s, you early youth, that has become prominent.


00:04:21:00 - 00:04:21:29
Frank Cook, J. Otis Williams or Leonard Feather:
When I was a millionaire.


00:04:22:05 - 00:04:47:20
Frank Cook, J. Otis Williams or Leonard Feather:
That's a long, long time before, Sonny Boy Williamson. All right, maybe you know why I say that I'm cheating. I heard you say that. You said it was. And then might have been Sonny Boy Jones of. Well, I love Muddy Waters. but, that's not muddy to me as it that it is very best.


00:04:47:20 - 00:04:53:22
Frank Cook, J. Otis Williams or Leonard Feather:
It's muddy. Real good. I'm gonna give that for.


00:04:53:24 - 00:05:02:17
Frank Cook, J. Otis Williams or Leonard Feather:
You. Yeah. Yeah, that's what it was. And, and then I did the harmonica player, too.


00:05:02:20 - 00:05:05:12
Frank Cook, J. Otis Williams or Leonard Feather:
A one, I guess. Oh.


00:05:05:14 - 00:05:20:29
Frank Cook, J. Otis Williams or Leonard Feather:
Well, I'm amazed at what city does said because, Well, I'm going to give it four stars and one. I was thinking that I was bored, and that's almost what he said. And I was thinking to myself, perhaps I've heard too much Hollywood jazz on, on on TV.


00:05:20:29 - 00:05:21:21
Frank Cook, J. Otis Williams or Leonard Feather:
Commercials and.


00:05:21:21 - 00:05:37:02
Frank Cook, J. Otis Williams or Leonard Feather:
Whatnot. but it was funny. I was allowed to say that I had no idea how you're going to feel about that. naturally, the musicianship is good, you know? I mean, technically it's good. And there are times when there's a little, little fire generated here that let.


00:05:37:02 - 00:05:42:26
Frank Cook, J. Otis Williams or Leonard Feather:
The drummer let you know. It's, Oh. You didn't notice.


00:05:42:26 - 00:06:06:10
Frank Cook, J. Otis Williams or Leonard Feather:
It? Yeah. I can't say I disliked anything, but I did get as Border City that and, think, thankfully, yeah. I have no idea whether, that have three stars because obviously the when we're working at the musicianship is. Yeah.


00:06:06:12 - 00:06:10:00
Frank Cook, J. Otis Williams or Leonard Feather:
Obviously. Yeah.


00:06:10:03 - 00:06:35:21
Frank Cook, J. Otis Williams or Leonard Feather:
Well, the last one bought me this one was it was a pain I couldn't wait for, for that thing to be over with because it more than irritating, really hurt and terrible back. Oh my God, you know, now the singer sounds like he might be an authentic Chicago blues man, but the background sounds like bullshit, you know, and that it's terrible.


00:06:35:23 - 00:06:59:00
Frank Cook, J. Otis Williams or Leonard Feather:
I got, you know, the instrumentalist. I was just off of those. Couldn't that. Those were real blues, man. I will abdicate my, tear up my Blues man card. Or maybe I never had one on this dark one, because maybe the captain was bad. This thing was in as much pain as that out of more than one star to help him get out of his misery.


00:06:59:03 - 00:07:06:28
Frank Cook, J. Otis Williams or Leonard Feather:
All right, so, like Johnny, like, I like the harmonica.


00:07:07:00 - 00:07:14:05
Frank Cook, J. Otis Williams or Leonard Feather:
And,


00:07:14:07 - 00:07:19:06
Frank Cook, J. Otis Williams or Leonard Feather:
And that was okay.


00:07:19:08 - 00:07:32:15
Frank Cook, J. Otis Williams or Leonard Feather:
But there wasn't really a whole lot happening. But I did, like, some of the way a general feel like what it's saying to him on the other side to.


00:07:32:17 - 00:07:33:09
Frank Cook, J. Otis Williams or Leonard Feather:
You know, we're going.


00:07:33:09 - 00:07:48:26
Frank Cook, J. Otis Williams or Leonard Feather:
To go over. Yeah. Again, like a 10%. Well, I can agree on that too. So. But I like the guitar solo on the bass.


00:07:48:28 - 00:08:06:14
Frank Cook, J. Otis Williams or Leonard Feather:
but basically that's what I liked about the whole thing, because the rest thing, we can kind of connect because the drums seem kind of weak, and then we can use so. When the guitar solo on the bass or going for.


00:08:06:16 - 00:08:29:07
Frank Cook, J. Otis Williams or Leonard Feather:
Oh yeah. We're pretty much against this guy. I really like the performance. sometimes in one hearing, you can't decide about it. Then I've, I've, I've become little more curious as a result of this comment. I'd like to hear the bass again, but it didn't affect me that first time. The piano player began to tickle me nearly as soon as the drummer.


00:08:29:13 - 00:08:44:29
Frank Cook, J. Otis Williams or Leonard Feather:
Yeah, you know where. I was almost with him there for a while because I began, like, almost like there was a. Yeah, like they were kidding me. And something near the end, even. But anyhow, let's see what the guitar player I really like. give it,


00:08:45:02 - 00:08:48:06
Frank Cook, J. Otis Williams or Leonard Feather:
Did you recognize that of the saxophone on the telephone?


00:08:48:09 - 00:09:05:05
Frank Cook, J. Otis Williams or Leonard Feather:
Hey, I heard him. No, I couldn't I couldn't decide what to tell where it was. It's an older man. Yeah, that's an older man. I heard a saxophone instead of a tenor saxophonist. I mean, I,


00:09:05:07 - 00:09:17:16
Frank Cook, J. Otis Williams or Leonard Feather:
Played up later the band or something, but, couldn't be. No, I mean, probably someone very close.
