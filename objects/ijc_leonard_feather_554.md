00:06:43:23 - 00:06:46:26
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
Life's been kind of get it wrong quite a bit again.


00:06:46:29 - 00:06:51:09
Leonard Feather:
First one thing another when you first leave the city permanently.


00:06:51:12 - 00:06:58:24
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
Well, I was about five years old and 5 or 6 very young. Oh, really? Well, whatever you read. So everybody in Kansas.


00:06:58:27 - 00:06:59:25
Leonard Feather:
In Topeka?


00:06:59:27 - 00:07:02:14
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
No, but the Kansas City, Kansas, my father church there.


00:07:02:16 - 00:07:04:00
Leonard Feather:
In Kansas City. You're right, I didn't.


00:07:04:08 - 00:07:29:03
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
And then we did. We move from there to Wichita probably when he moved so of been about, ten years old the first time. And I went back for forth considerable time. I mean, we had the most of the fan was there. And my father had a church, also a small town called El Dorado, Kansas. Our brother El Dorado was about 30 miles from Wichita.


00:07:29:06 - 00:07:51:07
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
Oh. So I've been with this and then this, this whole way to Kansas. Well, when I got some my first blues influence, because people in that town are from Arkansas, you know, and, Arkansas guitar players, harmonica players, stuff like that moved into that area. And with the railroads come in, they had the guys play harmonica and guitar.


00:07:51:07 - 00:08:10:13
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
That's it. That's coal. Gold Coast, you got a crane stuff to get the coal. That's a lot of guys play harmonica and do shops and stuff like that. You sing these old blues song, you know. So I got producing that, my father and mother went to, tour with the church conventions down south. I went south to.


00:08:10:15 - 00:08:21:12
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
Oh, yeah, I had a chance to hear a lot of things in the South, but, my theory that I was pressed about blues comes from being an army. Really?


00:08:21:15 - 00:08:27:16
Unknown Speaker:
My mother and father. And, when I was 41, I was. That's not.


00:08:27:18 - 00:08:48:02
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
Funny. That's 40. 41 on 42, 43, but part of 41. I've been down south. I met a girl. I met down south all and see her. And she was tell about people and bails and places. So we made a clip of it and with somebody else and, and, talked to the people around them. So I got a pretty good roots and things like that.


00:08:48:27 - 00:09:07:22
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
talk to people 80 years old and 1900 years old. They seem to know more about things than young people know. Now, this population blues quite a bit. I thought there's something really there. But I still didn't know it. I was still playing with it. But in the meantime, I get a lot of information about it. You? Yeah.


00:09:07:24 - 00:09:32:29
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
So, a year or two out of this Mississippi, Georgia, I was I was in Florida, an army. I went down to all of the little small towns around Florida. And this is Guy, and he's borrowing big guitars, drank beer, and then nothing. Then, always, always visit a church or church anywhere in town I went to always visit Holy Church and always, but, but, yeah, say something.


00:09:32:29 - 00:09:49:03
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
When I went to church and I always did say something and people invite me out for dinner. So at these home, I'd find people doing the same things. So I got, a lot information like that, too. Yeah. So my church background pretty heavy.


00:09:49:05 - 00:09:54:12
Leonard Feather:
How long in the Army? I don't know, three and a half years. Oh, so you got to, what, like 40.


00:09:54:14 - 00:09:56:25
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:

00:09:56:28 - 00:10:01:23
Leonard Feather:

00:10:11:14 - 00:10:27:29
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:

00:10:42:23 - 00:10:44:06
Leonard Feather:

00:11:05:07 - 00:11:10:13
Leonard Feather:
Of what happened. You get back out of the army.


00:11:10:15 - 00:11:37:25
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
I got back of army. I know what to do with Wichita, Kansas. And, they said they need the band rather than the band. You know, they got a place with no leader. so they the guys know me. So I became the leader of the band. So we had, saxophone. Trombone? play with them back to a.

Leonard Feather:
What were you doing? Balancing.


00:12:04:01 - 00:12:13:21
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
I was thinking all about it. Mostly, doing what was balance? because I work at, supper club places. And all I do think about is. I sing separate songs.


00:12:13:21 - 00:12:18:25
Unknown Speaker:

00:13:03:29 - 00:13:15:25
Leonard Feather:

00:13:15:28 - 00:13:21:04
Unknown Speaker:

00:13:32:26 - 00:13:37:27
Unknown Speaker:
It was a hit. And, the rhythm line was my line.


00:13:37:29 - 00:13:55:19
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
I thought about it in the church situation, and they. They did it. Well, I like the the meantime of this happened together. I had a few words, so I quit the band and I quit the band. I don't know what to do with time, but everybody said, I think so. Good. So I thought I'd go. Scargill. So let's go.


00:13:55:22 - 00:14:15:25
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
Okay, I'm a bass. And to find out what Scargill I got to go there by that was pretty well awful. Everything I would, I would do a up mess around with a friend. I got a job I got a job. I start playing bass and singing and stop playing bass. I sing, it's great. I said, I'll put the bass down as cargo.


00:14:15:28 - 00:14:22:03

00:14:31:21 - 00:14:38:13
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
Doctor Joe. Joe Adams, you know, and he had a hair shorter frame so that I just before the.


00:14:38:13 - 00:14:39:24
Leonard Feather:
Owners were advising a.


00:14:39:24 - 00:14:43:23
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
Little while was four years.


00:14:43:26 - 00:14:58:11
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
That I did him to work. And that particular guy that's playing at that frame. Crawford Fuller Chicago two.


00:14:58:14 - 00:15:15:09
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
From Fuller, Chicago two. I was sort of working class since go. So so.


00:15:15:12 - 00:15:17:08
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
So in Chicago at that.


00:15:17:11 - 00:15:19:03
Leonard Feather:
Was in college. You still have a band?


00:15:19:05 - 00:15:41:25
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
I think he does have. I'm not sure. And, the job went to a restaurant to make a pretty bad scar at one time. And so I went to Cincinnati. That's that's another restaurant that I work at the club. And I thought, maybe I'll agree, I agree, and I want to take the band with Texas.


00:15:41:27 - 00:15:51:22
Unknown Speaker:
The command, he's going to Texas about a year. So we played all this small town over here. I hear all the regular blues guys playing.


00:15:51:22 - 00:16:13:11
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
Americans at the back and stuff like that. So I learned a great deal from this. And so I thought what I would do after that one day and, talk to fans. But on paper, what I heard about blues and put it all together. And so, then Texas, I mean, my that I would be a blues singer because I seem to write.


00:16:13:11 - 00:16:37:15
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
Joe Turner was getting old. He didn't care about singing much anymore, so I figured it wrong with that man, you know? So I started to move in then, but I didn't know how quick, how to put them over the record, do certain things, I thought. So I got a bunch of records from Walker Brown and Joe Turner. listen, I studied, after I came back from Texas, I went south again on my own, and I had to slum.


00:16:37:15 - 00:16:42:21
Unknown Speaker:
In order to learn some of the things I learned. I had to hit it pretty hard.


00:16:42:24 - 00:16:59:23
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
This way, I was able to get into places where, you know, to go back and back in the barrios way back or somebody else. I could go back there then, because I was, I was ragged and I was dressed well there. I could make it. So I said, listen to stuff and, go around and talk to all the old people that we've got.


00:16:59:23 - 00:17:20:14
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
So they liked me very well. So they thought I was coming out of things by like a parable. And all those guys they knew about because they were, say, 80 years old and 90 years old, where I had been slaves and told all these long stories about slavery. Yeah. How it happened and what did happen with them. And that means a lot of things I didn't know.


00:17:20:17 - 00:17:38:23
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
So then I left. Then I caught a freight train and rode down Mississippi, got Mississippi all week. I drove and I was talking way out of trouble. And I got with people there, and I found a different kind of blues. Mississippi that would be in, Louisiana. you go on the go and you going on to Virginia, you find another kind of blues.


00:17:38:23 - 00:17:54:15
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
Virginia I did this and run around this area about a year and a half, just going to place one place another trying to learn. So I, I came back home, I got pretty rough start coming back home for.


00:17:54:19 - 00:17:59:09
Leonard Feather:
I came home. I can find the a different styles of singing and different styles of words both.


00:17:59:10 - 00:18:17:14
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
That's right. Like the flat like say thing that says flat, but they have a very different meaning. unless you're into the territory, you want to word about what the right of mean. so a lot of things I do now, I see them very flat, but just for reasons, not because I don't know any better. That's a very good reason.


00:18:17:16 - 00:18:41:00
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
So I figured been out. but I'll try to make it so, end up because my, my uncle in Detroit, I worked in flame sugar. he told me all the things where you come sing. I went to some booth. I ended up working 14 weeks with the Johnson there. They show, and then they bring in all the little things.


00:18:41:02 - 00:19:04:21
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
And I give you the hard way to go. There's still the stands. I got the same. I got just the same. There's still people back because I had open the show and you wrote the show for the most times for the spirit and everything. So started keep this up and kind of fall down. And so. I was dancing, dancing and singing.


00:19:04:23 - 00:19:12:26
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
Okay. So, Willie Brown had a show come, come from New York called Something Harlem Express or something like that.


00:19:13:01 - 00:19:15:02
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
He was a radio guy.


00:19:15:04 - 00:19:19:24
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
I did his show guitar. I said, I know.


00:19:19:24 - 00:19:26:02
Unknown Speaker:
I'm not playing on one in New York. Are you doing a lot of things that never happens. Willie Brown looking and.


00:19:26:04 - 00:19:26:20
Leonard Feather:
Are, you know.


00:19:26:21 - 00:19:33:02
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
Yeah, I think he is. I'm not sure I forgot about it, really, but I got to New York and what he said was that he.


00:19:33:02 - 00:19:34:17
Leonard Feather:
Was at 57.


00:19:34:20 - 00:19:54:00
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
I don't know if it seemed like it was. What do you say? What happened didn't happen. So I was in New York, like Stratton, more or less. So that's where I'm here. So they said that's where he's supposed to be covering it. So I said, I go Steeler. so I stayed there hotel the rest of the fellows and got me job.


00:19:54:02 - 00:19:55:24
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
Work. Okay. I from New York.


00:19:56:01 - 00:19:57:12
Leonard Feather:
No kidding.


00:19:57:14 - 00:20:10:17
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
I did the, jobs here in there, and I got to, I got one there to get them up to the social office. I've got a job, a social work, part time social work in New York. I like kids very much.


00:20:10:17 - 00:20:16:16
Unknown Speaker:
So this is right around morality for children. And right now I have opened it all.


00:20:16:16 - 00:20:38:18
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
Anytime I go back. And you can always go to the social worker if that's what I want to do. I did a very good job. I think I was there with children. And, this has been my 40 children. Okay. I like you very much. So I work with the summertime. I work all day camps as a counselor for children and, especially problem children.


00:20:39:25 - 00:20:53:26
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
and the and, I sung with them a song too long talks of songs and everything. Different camps. So in New York in the summertime, I have to call for camps. Both the Jewish camps where I worked in the summer was wonderful.


00:20:53:29 - 00:20:57:02
Leonard Feather:
Well, how did you finally get started as a singer? The,


00:20:57:04 - 00:21:19:22
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
Well, I kept bumming around like a dollar baby grab mad at saying so. I give a week's work. and then I went to Savoy Records and did a writer for the war. I did, and, it's got going on pretty good. And the visiting, like, things the way they were gone were going his way. So he pulled right off the market that I rhythm blues.


00:21:19:27 - 00:21:35:13
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
very good. And I had something going because I just, came out of Detroit. I heard Prophet Jones say all this. Well, I had a phone call as well. He tried to take the whole song. I couldn't take it. So he just pulled it off to market. Gave me one of the publisher.


00:21:35:15 - 00:21:44:02
Unknown Speaker:
And one of the American and. Oh, boy. Excuse me.


00:21:44:04 - 00:21:45:14
Unknown Speaker:
So, they took the record up.


00:21:45:14 - 00:21:57:02
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
So we took it off the market. It. But let me stop both around, and I got things start. I moved to Jamaica and I walked into a club one night. I need the sound. So I started singing wish Jamaica.


00:21:57:04 - 00:21:57:29
Leonard Feather:
As you know.


00:21:58:00 - 00:22:19:16
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
Up and up. My whole club sang in the clubs on the field at capacity. in Jamaica, I moved to make up the little man of ballroom. I started singing the one of the bands and all the clubs have had dances, so they always call me that work. It was to have a dance. I got a job. So I made my name in, Jamaica, Long Island.


00:22:19:23 - 00:22:23:18
Leonard Feather:
Most of the say when I first met you, I triumphed and I came in with Marilyn Monroe. She sang.


00:22:23:19 - 00:22:24:26
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
That's where I play poison.


00:22:24:26 - 00:22:25:20
Leonard Feather:
That's right.


00:22:25:22 - 00:22:33:20
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
My God, got. I started there about a year ago. 44 I sing, you know, I worked a man of bottle with soul.


00:22:33:20 - 00:22:42:01
Unknown Speaker:
Man like they are. They van dike, though. Didn't you play one of the jazz festivals before that? I did the,


00:22:42:03 - 00:23:02:22
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
South Bay. Yeah. so I got South Bay through, Well then what sustains me at the time and in Long Island. Oh yeah. He's late for a television show. Got for Yeah. And you couldn't make it, so I had to drive the show so that I got the they, they want me to stay over. So I stayed and watch the show for the meantime.


00:23:02:22 - 00:23:23:05
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
I tell off what I can say, and I know about this, and therefore, they will come up to sing it. The spur moment thing. So I, I was on television, well, I do the television. So this this led to other things like the festival. And I was getting my for opening in New York. after that, I got to be in demand.


00:23:23:21 - 00:23:51:09
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
the small clubs, you know, around the York places. So migrated from there into the. I had artist records. Yeah. I mean, my first LP, The Artist, and then to, that person's band and I went to Berlin. I was talking little the demand more so than other clubs, other places. I went to Boston Storyville back.


00:23:51:25 - 00:23:53:25
Unknown Speaker:
I that's about that there.


00:23:53:25 - 00:24:16:00
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
Back then the Berlin again. The next deal came was when, Don Hicks and I got him and I met down in Berlin. Was talking about tambourines, cannibal down. I also asked me about it. I played that night at Birdland Native. I was surprised to see it because never heard of it being a jazz club, you know. So they said they're going to buy one or they didn't know.


00:24:16:00 - 00:24:33:28
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
I don't know. So jokes I tell in about, the festival out here. so that's a good idea, you know, put a show on like there. we talked a few ideas about it, which is what you should put in the show. You said we're going to work a show at a certain point will be what? This movie myself.


00:24:34:00 - 00:24:49:20
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
I thought it'd be great if you work like that, I think, but, like, you know what? This was a pretty big man, so I probably wouldn't get out there, so you may. So we talked more about, the history of blues and where I started and how his father was preaching. My father preached, we talked these things over.


00:24:49:20 - 00:25:11:12
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
So I this is developed right there in Berlin, I think more or less. and, next thing I know, somebody asked about coming to Monterrey. I didn't know about it. So I got the message about coming. And so I made it out here. So the biggest break was, I'd say it would be through John Hendrix. Yeah, but I got to Monterey and I got to Monterey.


00:25:12:07 - 00:25:12:22
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
I met Everett.


00:25:12:22 - 00:25:18:16
Leonard Feather:
Townsend. Oh, that's how he came to Los Angeles. That's right.


00:25:18:19 - 00:25:35:11
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
But, when I left New York, everybody wished me very good luck out here. And I was kind of scared for it because I figure I could make it. Yeah, I felt like I had anything at all. It was too much, and everybody thought I did have. But I was still trying to figure out the best way to do it.


00:25:35:11 - 00:25:38:08
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
The best way to present it. Yeah, well.


00:25:38:10 - 00:25:48:21
Leonard Feather:
And to be pretty much pursuit of yourself. Not as, you know, with everything in the records, things of, I get nothing but.


00:25:48:21 - 00:26:11:05
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
Better, you know. Well, this is one of the greats who helped me in my life. I think, I don't really know how to accept, most of them because there's so many good things in them. You never know how many friends you have, really? Until something good happens for you. Like this. Yeah. And people who I didn't think even knew or even thought I said different than this has been a great experience for me.


00:26:11:07 - 00:26:23:21
Unknown Speaker:
Yeah. but, but all right. You know.


00:26:23:24 - 00:26:34:06
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
So, as I say, people said a lot of nice things. I know that, in New York, I understood why I met you. The. You were always on my side as a critic and otherwise, when.


00:26:34:06 - 00:26:35:29
Leonard Feather:
I was the good blues, you know?


00:26:35:29 - 00:26:44:22
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
And, this is a very short course. And I never met you before these things. And I was glad to have you aboard as a fan of sometime.


00:26:44:25 - 00:26:51:12
Unknown Speaker:
I'm an old admirer of, most of the good blues. I mean, most of the things that you would like.


00:26:51:15 - 00:26:55:10
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
So I'm this. I've gotten this. I worked for this for. I'm trying to.


00:26:55:10 - 00:27:06:04
Unknown Speaker:
Prove something now, but I'm trying. And I don't know whether I'm going the right way for doing it. I think I'm trying to do it. And so I was going to set of the blues has to be somebody who possibly.


00:27:06:06 - 00:27:10:18
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
Maybe drank quite a bit, which has been in the past.


00:27:10:20 - 00:27:19:08
Unknown Speaker:
You know, one thing or another. But I had a pretty clean record right? All the way through. Yeah, well, I agree with you. You have to be there. And,


00:27:19:10 - 00:27:35:24
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
My rock has been very clean. I've been always a gentleman. All clubs I worked in, I was go back. So I'm trying to work my thing to where I can put this act into the bigger supper clubs. Yeah. Nicer clubs where, where I can do as well as other things are going and be resort to, the back rooms.


00:27:35:24 - 00:27:37:11
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
Because I'm a little singer. Yeah.


00:27:37:11 - 00:27:41:07
Leonard Feather:
It's going well. How about all the buffalo that you were doing when I did during that period? It's not really.


00:27:41:10 - 00:27:50:20
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
Just out on a map. Well, as I said, I'm sorry. Trombone, really? Because I'm playing trombone, doing it from my veins. Yeah. That's why I like this mix very well of bass and time also.


00:27:50:20 - 00:27:52:04
Leonard Feather:
Between the two, what it did in the.


00:27:52:04 - 00:27:58:19
Unknown Speaker:
In some of the modern things. when I started my career in business. Well, I knew pretty well about knowing, but.


00:27:58:19 - 00:28:12:15
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
I was able to gather two things together. He was, another player so I could get too close to him because I was this type. so, you know, so I had to stay around this, but, But I still admire what he what he was doing. I admire his very much.


00:28:12:21 - 00:28:14:10
Leonard Feather:
Did you try to play like JJ? I'm from.


00:28:14:24 - 00:28:17:00
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
I try to try to,


00:28:17:03 - 00:28:24:12
Leonard Feather:
It's interesting because, you know, so far, most of the. From the blues, or at least from the type of music represented by this, and I listen.


00:28:24:14 - 00:28:29:02
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
I extrapolate from I would like,


00:28:29:04 - 00:28:30:10
Leonard Feather:
God, wouldn't that, this.


00:28:30:10 - 00:28:38:19
Unknown Speaker:
Is the first time that.


00:28:38:22 - 00:28:57:29
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
So I figured that this bop situation, I, try to construct things and cards, records, procedures of these numbers. Yeah. He's a car progresses. I can I know the change that run the car is pretty clean. Yeah. And then doing this, I think it, it's not too up to par for the public to understand what I'm trying to do.


00:28:58:02 - 00:29:02:22
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
Yeah. other words, I mean, my melodic line is always there. You can always hear where.


00:29:02:22 - 00:29:14:24
Unknown Speaker:
Part of it is you're not lost in the comments. So this this lends, I think the better hearing is most unusual for both of you to have that quality. You know, I don't think anybody else. It's been a real blessing that could.


00:29:14:26 - 00:29:21:17
Leonard Feather:
Either play or sing in that style. You know, most people don't have both traditions, you know, that they.


00:29:21:19 - 00:29:35:04
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
Live in one world or the other. I'm pretty lucky. I think I can do about what I want to do. I think some cases, I think classical. So I have some classical, and I still do occasionally on some shows.


00:29:35:04 - 00:29:44:11
Unknown Speaker:
If I get the right clue, I will. I will recommend a classical kind of thing. And I do like a lot of song. Hey, they're pretty heavy numbers. I do.


00:29:44:11 - 00:29:45:06
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
Remember other stuff like.


00:29:45:06 - 00:29:50:18
Unknown Speaker:
This. Same stuff. Yeah. And,


00:29:50:21 - 00:29:53:18
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
Perversely, I've been a fan. But I'm lucky, though.


00:29:53:21 - 00:30:01:23
Unknown Speaker:
Oh. Good luck. As a result of the talent, you're like some of the things I'm doing. like, I sing half.


00:30:01:23 - 00:30:09:05
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
Time or some things and, missing for for missing 6 or 8 or whatever may be. Every single one of me hits me. I'll sing this thing.


00:30:09:06 - 00:30:14:26
Unknown Speaker:
Yeah. And, I think that's a little different. Different? Look at blues.


00:30:14:28 - 00:30:20:16
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
Yeah, yeah, it's just the fundamentals are the same.


00:30:20:18 - 00:30:23:05
Leonard Feather:
Who are some of the people that, the early.


00:30:23:05 - 00:30:27:24
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
Influences? Well, I see, I like I still say I like World of Joe Turner.


00:30:28:01 - 00:30:35:12
Unknown Speaker:
Yeah. For me. Yeah. Sounds like. Yeah, that's. This is where I really am. I think most time.


00:30:35:14 - 00:30:41:02
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
I'm able, I'm able to shout. I mean, the whole thing is, did both of these, it's right.


00:30:41:04 - 00:30:45:00
Leonard Feather:
To just not even of the country type of thing is like music.


00:30:45:03 - 00:30:47:28
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
Well, I thought for me they were a little bit too carefree.


00:30:48:00 - 00:30:49:04
Leonard Feather:
Yeah.


00:30:49:07 - 00:31:16:13
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
See, I think, music and some people think there's two. As a song tends to slow down life. I've been so warm. I think the singing should also do the same things. Close up out, to a crawl. Yeah, but it can't sit as I remember it. the hippie Johnson and the sellers, they they always moving up to the pace, you know, and everything's pretty heavy, and that's okay.


00:31:16:13 - 00:31:38:03
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
But I feel happy. We say at all times. Not too good of a thing. And the spirit always helps. And spark is something you have to have a bad day and get some kind of spark going. Today. You don't look so bad, you know? So I my blues, I try to to, make a happy medium. I figure people feel the beat of things a little more, you know?


00:31:38:04 - 00:32:05:25
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
And if I sing, I try to sing with some kind of tempo. This way is there's something always driving, you know, you get too slow. You have nothing driving. Yeah, but having with little Bastard, you always got something going for you. So I kind of. I'm trying to capture that, feeling of I can sometimes it's pretty rough to capture this because inadequacy of certain musicians.


00:32:05:27 - 00:32:07:04
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
Who were who started.


00:32:07:07 - 00:32:12:05
Unknown Speaker:
In the middle of the game, you know, and they don't know the rudiments of things. Yeah. That's right.


00:32:12:08 - 00:32:28:18
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
And by starting the middle, they missed a lot of things. Start in the middle of pretty big musicians are great. you know, most young guys come now. They missed the first part, so they can't come around the middle. Yeah. So when it gets down to the fundamental things where you should know how to do certain things they don't know.


00:32:28:20 - 00:32:30:12
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
Yeah. And to explain it to them.


00:32:30:13 - 00:32:36:17
Unknown Speaker:
Fact Greek. so this is bereft of sense. so I'm.


00:32:36:17 - 00:32:51:20
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
One of the few people who can play, you know, appreciate the fact that those who can and those who can't play are both at the same. I play with them what they can do. I do what they can do. Yeah, they can do what I can do. I say, okay, I just myself to you that I can.


00:32:51:20 - 00:32:56:05
Leonard Feather:
Do this for you. What was that thing you started to tell the other the phone about? So.


00:32:56:08 - 00:33:19:25
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
Well, I think, so this way just getting out of hand. I think right now, at the present time. Everybody has a soul. I think if you look through life, you'll find that every race of people say, we'll say race because this is where it happened. I think now has something they call soul as far as they're concerned.


00:33:19:27 - 00:33:37:04
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
I think, people say, well, all the people have sold a certain group of people. This is wrong. You know, we all have some type of soul and we all try to generate this. So whenever we have a chance to do so. But now all of a sudden, there's some people who try to keep saying, well, all of these people have sold in the past and do it.


00:33:37:06 - 00:33:55:27
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
And also, if you see it long enough, somebody's gonna believe this. Yeah, well, see this? This sounds good, but it's. But it hurts everybody else when you say it. Yeah. So I think we should learn to equalize feelings, equalize ourselves and understanding and being together and and always remember the word togetherness.


00:33:56:00 - 00:33:58:27
Leonard Feather:
Who are some white singers? Do they have? So I like.


00:33:58:27 - 00:34:17:21
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
Mel, Tommy, Joe Stafford, lot a soul. Donna. Sure. I think has a lot of one of us. be truthful about it. And also, like, Perry Como school. He has he's very fresh.


00:34:17:24 - 00:34:21:20
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
What about the blues? Things like Tiger.


00:34:21:22 - 00:34:36:24
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
Or Tiger. I was on a singing that's additional thing which he he felt where he was locations. But then here we go. The same thing he was, he was in the movement. So by being in the mood you knows a saying when he hear the sing and then you go you to sing this whole. Yeah. You sing just what he knows a thing.


00:34:37:01 - 00:34:52:10
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
Yeah. And the way he feels and we get it. Yeah. So he has soul also you know you take with her and with him do the same thing. You feel a certain thing. You better have the same, voice structure that I have and ask me here, but what do you, what do you sing. And he's doing just like he thinks.


00:34:52:10 - 00:35:17:29
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
Yeah. Frankie Laine, he's strong. Sobre. Yeah. Very strong. But we forget these people here is not just one one, 111 person. All these things I play with, musicians and I think, some are soul brothers. I say, zoo sims, regardless where he got it from. He got it. Yeah. And he sounds just like you. Means what he's saying.


00:35:18:01 - 00:35:49:00
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
And I sound like southern man. It's a very surprising drummer. Very surprising. Scary. This rat female piano player that Pierce. Yeah. All these fellows, they all have soul. I mean, they they have their own little class. Everybody's in a class, and everybody came in the same place. But there is room in the world of all classes for you to get out this thing and just work it out together, because right now, musicians become enemies of one another where the soul things go.


00:35:49:02 - 00:35:55:03
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
Yeah, I think this is a bad thing that happens. It's going to wreck the whole situation.

00:36:31:29 - 00:36:33:24

00:36:34:17 - 00:36:35:28

00:36:57:04 - 00:36:57:16
Leonard Feather:
Oh, once.


00:36:57:23 - 00:37:00:02
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
Must have been married once.


00:37:00:05 - 00:37:00:23
Leonard Feather:
No children.


00:37:00:28 - 00:37:02:12
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
But this was on social gatherings.


00:37:02:12 - 00:37:09:09
Unknown Speaker:
So, no children involved. So we were happy that happened because, I mean, the children I.


00:37:09:09 - 00:37:12:10
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
Will stay with a now because, I was a kid so much.


00:37:12:18 - 00:37:16:16
Unknown Speaker:
Yeah. I'm.


00:37:16:18 - 00:37:26:26
Unknown Speaker:
Gonna get a pretty good. Thank you. That. Goes on. Yeah.


00:37:26:28 - 00:37:29:17
Leonard Feather:
What were you saying about the.


00:37:29:28 - 00:37:49:24
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
Jewish. The Jewish people have a have a have a deep faith. You going to they they they were like, they've been through slavery, neighbor. And, they had blues traveler tribulations. And but they talk in their own language about these things. So they had their own feelings about them. But you sing some Jewish song, you find Jews are cry like babies, like we do with single.


00:37:49:26 - 00:38:02:15
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
So that means they have roots, you know, and I play loud dance for Syrian people and let's listen to songs. They sing a song like Blues Me yeah, but a different little thing on. But it's something that touches them.


00:38:02:21 - 00:38:03:26
Leonard Feather:
Yeah.


00:38:03:28 - 00:38:13:27
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:
And I've been through this situation. So I figure that, everybody understands the blues. Everybody knows the blues, regardless what they say. They know it and understand.


00:38:13:27 - 00:38:25:15
Unknown Speaker:
Because they've been through it and.


00:38:25:17 - 00:38:47:14
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Johnny, him his son allows you to walk behind, follow. What I say this. Time on. No matter what time did miles and pain. The same little good character, though it's time to hear you. I mean, you go through and whatnot, but then with me is a lot of character degenerate.


00:38:47:14 - 00:38:48:17
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
What's your guess on that one?


00:38:48:18 - 00:38:49:16
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Miles on I.


00:38:49:16 - 00:38:51:02
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:

00:38:51:02 - 00:38:54:16
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:

00:38:54:18 - 00:38:55:18
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:

00:38:55:20 - 00:38:59:01
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:

00:39:10:03 - 00:39:11:03
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:

00:39:11:06 - 00:39:12:14
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Trying to be.


00:39:13:02 - 00:39:15:25
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:

00:39:15:27 - 00:39:20:06
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:

00:39:20:08 - 00:39:21:18

Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Ran out in the hall and worked key some type of that. I borrow.


00:39:25:28 - 00:39:27:08
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Flanagan's first band out of that.


00:39:27:10 - 00:39:32:19
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:

00:39:32:26 - 00:39:33:24
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
This is a mistake. The next.


00:39:33:24 - 00:39:34:04
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Day it was the.


00:39:34:04 - 00:39:35:01
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Reputation was very.


00:39:35:01 - 00:39:41:00
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Poorly for the day we went out and we found this the minute lucky he was working. This guy.


00:39:41:02 - 00:39:41:14
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Back in.


00:39:41:16 - 00:39:44:12
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
New York. So you got to tell me if you haven't seen this of the record.


00:39:44:12 - 00:39:45:21
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
And I'm still on about it.


00:39:45:27 - 00:40:04:23
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
And I have to show you the Charlie Parker still climbing, taking consideration that he hadn't been on since he left our alliance. This thing just went straight party. Strange. We just picked it up. Called what Does he Did? It's only a tribute to his talent and the fact that, you know, it's it's nice to give that type of credit with.


00:40:04:27 - 00:40:11:05
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Do. And Miles is the most determined young kid in the world. Miles wrote every note up on paper.


00:40:11:09 - 00:40:12:09
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Now, the statement literally.


00:40:12:12 - 00:40:13:02
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:

Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Ella Fitzgerald composition Gulf Coast.


00:40:16:16 - 00:40:20:27
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
And the only other time that ever happened, I think it went down against states on this.


00:40:22:04 - 00:40:28:07
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
well, you can only go and say no, you have a 50% chance. Oh, let's get a consensus from our board.


00:40:28:15 - 00:40:29:13
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
we could you say?


00:40:29:15 - 00:40:30:12
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Yes, my.


00:40:30:14 - 00:40:30:20
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Little.


00:40:30:21 - 00:40:39:14
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Sisters from David for 9:00 in the morning. He's working on CBS, not being showed up at 1140 and made for some of the 20 minutes.


00:40:39:16 - 00:40:41:20
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Well, I would say it's not Oscar.


00:40:41:23 - 00:40:43:17
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Predator was on a date.


00:40:43:19 - 00:40:52:20
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Obviously, as was I was a nonunion drummer. He had trouble about it. And you want to say he happens to be Ella Fitzgerald? And so I'll recommend a poem.


00:40:52:20 - 00:40:53:25
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Just what I want to talk about.


00:40:53:29 - 00:40:55:27
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
This guy is out of his dressing and.


00:40:55:29 - 00:40:56:20
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
And I sometimes.


00:40:56:20 - 00:40:57:16
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
I can go.


00:40:57:19 - 00:41:00:08
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Wrong in speaking about arrangements from budget.


00:41:00:10 - 00:41:01:01
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Second,


00:41:01:03 - 00:41:06:05
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
We got Oscar credit for it to get an Oscar credit if it so loving Vermont. The idea of an all star band.


00:41:06:08 - 00:41:07:08
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Oh yeah. The big band.


00:41:07:15 - 00:41:22:24
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
And they come in studio 16 men. Johnny Boswell, Toby Young, vampires, shadow and Holly stars. I'm sorry them that one notices. But what the shadow and Shelly. Man, this is right.


00:41:22:24 - 00:41:23:08
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Yeah.


00:41:23:10 - 00:41:35:29
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
That's the first one Shelly recorded. And the other thing that was real funny and fuzzy back. And then everybody gave us of the credits for them. Years all the time. It was really cool. Well, so. Peanuts. I can't get started with me.


00:41:36:00 - 00:41:36:23
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
How could you?


00:41:36:25 - 00:41:39:03
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Not everybody gave Truman the credit. No.


00:41:39:06 - 00:41:40:03
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
It's true.


00:41:40:05 - 00:41:43:11
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Finally. But the beginning of Google was getting a lot of credit.


00:41:43:13 - 00:41:47:12
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
So what happened? Instead of just fake some header. Right. Well, I don't think was recorded.


00:41:47:14 - 00:41:50:20
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Well, I did, a blues rubber legs.


00:41:50:23 - 00:41:51:01
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Yeah.


00:41:51:07 - 00:41:54:13
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
I realized they faked a couple of things.


00:41:54:13 - 00:41:55:10
Clarence Horatius "Big" Miller:

00:42:08:15 - 00:42:09:18
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:

Was that I stay in the movie you, jelly and the other states. and with the beginning of the record date, the first rehearsal was called to be in the opera, and it was called for 12:00.


00:42:31:25 - 00:42:55:27
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
And at 530, the only people that showed up was Billy Eckstein. Some me, me and Clyde. And the guy who was in charge of the day, what was his name? He was, you know, the with. And, the next day we had the rehearsal and, we had Disney shorts for college wrestling. But there was the first review and we baked the dean.

00:43:10:20 - 00:43:13:00
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:

00:43:13:01 - 00:43:14:05
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Yeah.


00:43:14:07 - 00:43:24:06
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
As a matter of fact, the some of the guys that still missed rehearsal and the band was not what was originally intended to be was a couple of changes. That was before Billy.


00:43:24:06 - 00:43:26:03
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Just before him on the band.


00:43:26:05 - 00:43:28:02
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Yeah. And was the David of the All Stars.


00:43:28:02 - 00:43:33:19
Unknown Speaker:
And anyone got a band together?


00:43:33:22 - 00:43:36:05
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
So the only date in my room.


00:43:36:07 - 00:43:50:21
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
When I was live was there wasn't one. I was just that I was there with Clyde cloud was right in the music, and I was just helping up. Not right. You know, one of the people I know, he was working in the club single, and Tommy had the band. And then the release band was by Johnson or no.


00:43:50:23 - 00:43:57:28
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Yeah, that was a real funny thing. They were at work across the street right now in the Onyx Club, and it was the same band then. It was


00:43:58:00 - 00:43:59:21
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
And it was awesome and relaxing.


00:43:59:21 - 00:44:11:27
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
And then they went on stage. The the outcome is. But man, yeah, the money when the deuces it was this is back with the same personnel. Yeah I'm from another hectic time of 50s for five weeks.


00:44:11:29 - 00:44:12:08
Leonard Feather:
You think.


00:44:12:14 - 00:44:16:18
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
They had the same rhythm section and five different leaders album from each week was another.


00:44:16:18 - 00:44:17:19
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Leader and it.


00:44:17:21 - 00:44:48:20
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Was just the band. Parker, New York. One of the guests was in class on the rhythm section and one week was Herbie Seals and Bob Dorsey. What were you in that project? And along those two other guys? Well, they were, I can't remember not, but it was all the same three guys. But somebody else heard about the that's where the scene was jumping and, and they, they went down, Charlie said was it was Charlie Shavers band combined and not Jaffe and Johnny Canary and Alvin Stoller.


00:44:48:25 - 00:45:10:16
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Do you remember that? Then he came up the street and went in. The doses of his numbers has been with Charlie. Yeah. But it was it was an error that I don't think will ever could ever be done again. And it was too fantastic to be real. There's so much talent. You can walk on the right rows at the bar and get enough guys together to make 3 or 4 good record sessions.


00:45:10:16 - 00:45:16:27
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
And so and the record was so good. Yeah. I mean, you could sell 50,000 records on most anything.


00:45:17:06 - 00:45:19:01
Leonard Feather:
on those strictly jazz records.


00:45:19:03 - 00:45:32:21
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
And those they I mean, would I have, like, Dexter Gordon things in one? Not the first. Dexter sold about 40, 50,000 records. That's right. And some of them, Don Byas records like Candy to each his own and they were hitting close to 40,000.


00:45:32:23 - 00:45:34:14
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
That is really amazing.


00:45:34:16 - 00:45:36:05
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Of course, the.


00:45:36:19 - 00:45:41:17
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
The well, I mean, them days, I was just get a record out knew in business.


00:45:41:19 - 00:45:44:28
Leonard Feather:
Yeah, yeah. So.


00:45:45:01 - 00:46:01:10
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
And then it was just you got to be 77. You were straight that it was somebody else to see. It wasn't about Collins and it was not really violence. And it wasn't a radical because seeing one guy angle ain't a synonym. And Jesus, you were straight. You know.


00:46:01:12 - 00:46:03:07
Leonard Feather:
Yeah. It was really hitting is.


00:46:03:10 - 00:46:14:12
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
All you gotta do is take it out to the thing, take it out in the afternoon and play it on that Long Island station and come back in the evening and play it on W.H.O.. and it was straight.


00:46:14:14 - 00:46:16:00
Leonard Feather:
You know, it's much more complicated.


00:46:16:01 - 00:46:22:15
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
The only time I yourself said I was in the arms and dinosaur. You yourself were saying hundreds of thousands.


00:46:22:15 - 00:46:24:10
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Yeah, but that was much more. remember.


00:46:24:10 - 00:46:25:20
Leonard Feather:
Those record that I'm.


00:46:25:22 - 00:46:28:12
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
I mean, it was a jazz day, Lester Young.


00:46:28:14 - 00:46:31:10
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
I wasn't there. That was with some of those guys.


00:46:31:12 - 00:46:39:10
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Why didn't you do the Lester Young in the Johnny on everything? No, that wasn't the answer. I thought that was you. Well, even they sold it. They.


00:46:39:11 - 00:46:39:21
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
So.


00:46:39:24 - 00:46:46:13
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
That's right. You can get me there with six figures. I wouldn't,


00:46:46:15 - 00:46:50:22
Leonard Feather:
There.


00:46:51:12 - 00:46:53:20
Leonard Feather:
you know, a mix of things happened to me in those story.


00:46:53:22 - 00:47:02:21
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Oh, I'd say there's something else that I just can't think of it right now.


00:47:02:24 - 00:47:15:11
Leonard Feather:

He'd holler out the keys, a natural and natural, and I've fallen. So after modulating in about ten different keys, we we. After we finished the number, he called in a mission again.

Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
I love Duke.


00:48:31:06 - 00:48:33:25
Leonard Feather:
Yeah, well, I was wondering if Duke loves you. I mentioned this earlier.


00:48:33:25 - 00:48:36:15
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
You probably. And I love Billy Strayhorn.


00:48:36:17 - 00:48:41:17

Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Yes I did.


00:48:43:00 - 00:48:46:00
Leonard Feather:
I did because that was while you were in Philly. I was hoping you had seen that.


00:48:46:22 - 00:48:50:24
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
I saw a friend of mine sent it to me from Washington.


00:48:50:25 - 00:48:56:10
Unknown Speaker:
Oh, it's from.


00:48:56:12 - 00:49:00:17
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
That's the only band I'd actually like to work with.


00:49:02:04 - 00:49:12:22
Leonard Feather:
Yeah. What other parents have you had any extensive contact with? Do you know Garner fairly well?


00:49:12:28 - 00:49:15:00
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Yes, I know Garner.


00:49:15:03 - 00:49:16:10
Leonard Feather:
Does he like you? As far as you know?


00:49:16:29 - 00:49:18:20
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
I don't know, I like him.


00:49:18:21 - 00:49:24:08
Leonard Feather:
He resents possibility, resents you for something. I know I don't.


00:49:24:10 - 00:49:35:22
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
I like him very much. He doesn't seem to be because, whenever we're, you know, close working in the same town or something, we usually comes at a club. He was in a.


00:49:35:24 - 00:49:41:04
Leonard Feather:
Nightclub the other night. Yeah. You know Peterson?


00:49:41:07 - 00:49:44:15
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
No, I've never met Peterson like him. Okay.


00:49:44:16 - 00:49:46:28
Leonard Feather:
Rich, you met Sherry?


00:49:47:00 - 00:49:50:02
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Yes. You introduced me to Sherry when he first came to town.


00:49:50:09 - 00:49:51:16
Leonard Feather:
Yeah. That's right.


00:49:51:19 - 00:49:56:02
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
I used to take him back and forth across the street from the.


00:49:56:05 - 00:49:56:26
Leonard Feather:
Producers.


00:49:56:26 - 00:50:08:07
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
To the movie when I was working. When you're getting a job and the. What was the name of that at the club? Bionics. Bionics? Yeah.


00:50:08:10 - 00:50:13:00
Leonard Feather:
And that's where.


00:50:13:02 - 00:50:21:12
Leonard Feather:
To get it right. You probably have any idea that anything is going to happen with him. I don't think many people do because he in fact, he wasn't playing nearly as well as he does now.


00:50:21:14 - 00:50:28:25
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Yesterday, being.


00:50:29:04 - 00:50:31:24
Leonard Feather:
was having.


00:50:31:26 - 00:50:44:20
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
A song out.


00:50:44:22 - 00:50:49:06
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Because I think Ray is just about the only guy before a band is caring for trombones, isn't it?


00:50:49:09 - 00:51:10:24
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Does the panel of experts want to go along with Mel Torme? I know December well. Well, you you're really blowing this one. That was Ralph Flanagan again. Was it really is the next.


00:51:16:18 - 00:51:17:13
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
What do you say, Mel?


00:51:17:16 - 00:51:20:17
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
That's on the other side of Wham! Reba. Boom, bam.


00:51:20:21 - 00:51:22:29
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Yeah. You know, the other side of Out of Golden Dreams.


00:51:22:29 - 00:51:23:22
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
That's Glenn Miller.


00:51:23:29 - 00:51:56:28
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
I would say, Marshall, I don't know. Well, anyway, nobody disagrees. So I guess we'll let you get away with that one. You happened to be right. It is Glenn Miller comedy. And here's the fourth and last.


00:51:57:01 - 00:52:03:17
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Virginia Wicks. What's your guess on that one? Anthony. Yes, they were Anthony and Bob Buck. What would you say?


00:52:03:20 - 00:52:04:25
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Oh, wouldn't you rather.


00:52:04:27 - 00:52:06:08
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
I'd say Jerry agree on that.


00:52:06:08 - 00:52:19:06
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
One. And I'd say it takes burning it. Well we have to pick one of those three. As a matter of fact, you lost the question anyway because you already got two parts out of four wrong. So I'll tell you, Mel Tormé, you were right. It was Jerry Gray's record of blue skies. But you can't tell those people apart.


00:52:19:06 - 00:52:26:04
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
I can't believe it's a very tough question. You made a good point. They're all indistinguishable. Yeah, I won't I didn't make the point. The bands made it for themselves.


00:52:26:04 - 00:52:35:14
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
I worked with Ralph. The reason I said that was because I had worked with Ralph Flanagan. I could be very wrong. But the second record, which also was Flanagan, sounded like it had four trombones. I think it was make believe it.


00:52:35:17 - 00:52:39:27
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Well, I think it was Flanagan's first band out of that rainbow record album, you know, because I work with in the middle of the.


00:52:39:27 - 00:52:43:01
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Year and he only had three trombones, six brand oh seven brass.


00:52:43:02 - 00:52:57:03
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
This is a misleading record. Anyway, the whole question was very tricky, I admit that. Well, there you are. Now. You admitted it was a true or false question from Gus Ackerman of New York City. You must get all three parts, right? We'll play the record and then make the statement about it. Okay.


00:52:57:05 - 00:53:02:08
Leonard Feather:
I've been through all day.


00:53:02:10 - 00:53:06:16
Unknown Speaker:
My man's gone away.


00:53:06:18 - 00:53:13:08
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
He left his mama go for another gig now.


00:53:13:29 - 00:53:16:11
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
so.


00:53:16:14 - 00:53:18:28
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
I tried to trade him.


00:53:18:28 - 00:53:40:22
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Come. now, the statement here is this is Ella Fitzgerald singing Clarence Williams composition Gulf Coast Blues on a Decca record. True or false? Marshall Stearns, what would you say? No. Well, you can only I know I'd say no. You have a 50% chance. No. Let's get a consensus from our board. Would you say no? Yes. Male termite.


00:53:40:24 - 00:53:41:00
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Well, it.


00:53:41:00 - 00:53:49:23
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Sounds like Ella, but there are certain things that, That the girl just sang that don't sound like Ella. I would say it might just be a carbon copy of Ella Babcock.


00:53:49:25 - 00:53:55:03
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Well, I would say it's not Ella. Well, that's three out of four. So whatever you say. Virginia.


00:53:55:05 - 00:53:56:19
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Well, I guess it's not.


00:53:56:19 - 00:54:08:07
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Although this sounds like it. And you are Ella's press agent. Wow. And happens to be Ella Fitzgerald and I. I'll recommend it. But the statement about the record is true. It is out of Fitzgerald singing Clarence Williams composition. Gonna see how wrong.


00:54:08:07 - 00:54:09:10
Leonard Feather:
You're gonna be.


00:54:09:13 - 00:54:11:20
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
How wrong can you be? Well, here's the second one.


00:54:11:22 - 00:54:30:29
Unknown Speaker:
Sounded like Billie.


00:54:31:02 - 00:54:31:17
Unknown Speaker:
Now.


00:54:31:19 - 00:54:38:18
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
The statement is This is Roy Eldridge playing Gershwin's The Man I love, recorded in Stockholm, Sweden, which is. That was true or false mill.


00:54:38:18 - 00:54:41:20
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
I really don't know. I've never heard that record.


00:54:41:22 - 00:54:46:05
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Well, at a guess what you say? It's true. Well,


00:54:46:08 - 00:54:51:00
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
How can you guess something like that? Leonard? I'll go along with it and say it's true.


00:54:51:02 - 00:54:54:15
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Virginia with me is just a guess, too. I'll say it's true.


00:54:54:18 - 00:55:02:00
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Bob. Well, I don't think it was recorded in Stockholm. You know, Marshall, I think.


00:55:02:00 - 00:55:03:13
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
It was Billy Rush.


00:55:03:16 - 00:55:04:09
Leonard Feather:
Yeah.


00:55:04:12 - 00:55:21:16
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Well, I'm trying to figure out you, Leonard. I'm convinced that you're not kidding. So this is true? this is too bad it was royalties, all right? And it was. Man, I love all right, but it wasn't recorded in Stockholm as Bob said. Why don't you like Stockholm? Yeah, that's the tune. I got news for you. It was recorded in Paris, France.


00:55:21:19 - 00:56:51:22
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Well, that's the difference in the third world.


00:56:51:24 - 00:57:00:05
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
The statement is this record of Don't Blame Me features the original King Cole trio with Oscar Muir on guitar. Two of False.


00:57:00:07 - 00:57:01:16
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
I would say it was false.


00:57:01:16 - 00:57:07:16
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Well, it's about. We only have time for one statement. And you happen to be right, Mel Tormé. It's false. Is the Page Cavanaugh trio. I said.


00:57:07:18 - 00:57:07:23
Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
What it.


00:57:07:23 - 00:57:26:25
