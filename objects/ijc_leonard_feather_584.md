# Stacy Rowles and Jimmy Rowles Blindfold Test [transcript]

00:00:00:00 - 00:00:47:05
Leonard Feather:
Presentation of the Leonard Feather Show is made possible through a grant from David Labo, suppliers of fine pianos for home and professional use.


00:00:47:07 - 00:01:07:24
Leonard Feather:
And once again, great news and modulations. This is Leonard Feather. Bring you an hour of jazz. A very unusual show today. If you were listening last week, you know that we had as our guests. Stacey Rose and her father, Jimmy Rose, the great flugelhorn, a son, pianist and composer, respectively. And at the end of the show, I said they'd like to stay over and a blindfold test, which they did.


00:01:08:01 - 00:01:11:03
Leonard Feather:
And that's what you're going to hear now. So welcome back, Stacey.


00:01:11:05 - 00:01:11:22
Stacy Rowles:
Hello.


00:01:11:23 - 00:01:12:17
Leonard Feather:
Are you ready?


00:01:12:19 - 00:01:13:25
Stacy Rowles:
I guess so.


00:01:13:28 - 00:01:27:11
Leonard Feather:
Jimmy, you've done this before, haven't you? Some years ago. I've never done a blindfold test with me. I didn't realize that, but I'm glad it's a it's a first for both of you. That. So I'm going to play some records, and all you have to do is listen to them. And if you want to make notes, make notes.


00:01:27:11 - 00:01:44:17
Leonard Feather:
I got some paper and pens here and stuff and just, you know, say what you think of the composition, the arrangement, the soloist, the recording, who you think it is. Anything you want to say about it? anything goes. And, if you're ready. You got the pencil? Yeah. You both have a penny. Both a sheet of paper.


00:01:44:19 - 00:01:54:29
Leonard Feather:
So here we go with the record number one.


00:01:55:01 - 00:02:00:10

00:06:16:04 - 00:08:02:15
Unknown Speaker:
Ha!


00:08:02:18 - 00:08:09:09
Leonard Feather:
Okay. It's a very long can. I guess we can fade it safely down and ask your opinion. So who wants to go first?


00:08:09:12 - 00:08:22:18
Stacy Rowles:
Well, I'll take a shot at it, okay? I don't know. I don't recognize the horn player right away, but I really liked, his sound.


00:08:24:21 - 00:08:48:06
Stacy Rowles:
I like the modal thing that he went into. Yeah. I like modal playing a lot. But there's a point where it just gets too much and too monotonous. You lose the. Yeah. The you know melodic. I really enjoy melodic playing much more. But modal playing is, is nice. I don't know, I thought maybe it might be Woody Shaw, but I don't know.


00:08:48:06 - 00:08:53:07
Stacy Rowles:
I don't really recognize the player right away. Sounded great to me though. Excellent.


00:08:53:13 - 00:08:56:25
Leonard Feather:
Would you, would you four out of five or something like that?


00:08:56:28 - 00:08:59:13
Stacy Rowles:
oh yeah. Excellent. Yeah, sure.


00:08:59:15 - 00:09:00:26
Leonard Feather:
Jimmy, how about you?


00:09:00:28 - 00:09:05:13
Jimmy Rowles:
I would rate that very highly. And I thought of Woody Shaw.


00:09:09:25 - 00:09:34:04
Jimmy Rowles:
I haven't heard enough of, of, when Marsalis. I know he plays, no. Perfect. But, I think I've heard other players, and I had the feeling that they played with a little more soul. I don't know whether, that's the right way to put it or not.


00:09:34:06 - 00:09:36:27
Leonard Feather:
Be more so than Wynton. Yes, I see what you mean.


00:09:36:27 - 00:09:49:18
Jimmy Rowles:
Like, more a little more of a natural, unschooled? Yeah. Is that the right way to say it? But, I thought of Woody Shaw and,


00:09:49:20 - 00:09:50:21
Leonard Feather:
How about the piano?


00:09:50:23 - 00:10:00:29
Jimmy Rowles:
The piano? I thought of maybe, some New York pianist. I think, it could be, it could be that it was Yanni.


00:10:01:25 - 00:10:08:22
Jimmy Rowles:
And it could also maybe be Ronnie Matthews or Lychee.


00:10:08:25 - 00:10:10:00
Leonard Feather:
Well, never mind who it was.


00:10:10:07 - 00:10:14:05
Jimmy Rowles:
I don't know, but whatever it was, it was very tasty. I like that record.


00:10:14:10 - 00:10:40:13
Leonard Feather:
Okay. Well, I'm glad you liked it. As a matter of fact, Jimmy was a little bit closer than Stacy because at least he mentioned Wynton Marsalis. And that's where it was. it was Winton's, album. Jaimoe the title track from that, his composition J. Mood. And the pianist was Marcus Roberts. I guess you probably don't know Marcus Roberts fairly recent addition to the West Marsalis Quartet, Robert Leslie Hurst on bass and Jeff Watts on drums.


00:10:40:15 - 00:10:43:12
Leonard Feather:
So are you. I guess neither of you heard that much of Wynton in person.


00:10:43:12 - 00:10:44:12
Stacy Rowles:
Oh, I sure haven't.


00:10:44:12 - 00:10:48:00
Jimmy Rowles:
That one, really. Most of it has been like she has described.


00:10:48:26 - 00:10:57:05
Stacy Rowles:
Most of the stuff they play that I hear is much more uptempo and real modal, just real. It's fun to listen to, you know? But.


00:10:57:27 - 00:11:02:14
Stacy Rowles:
I don't know. It's just that it just that one really stopped me. I didn't know who that was at all.


00:11:02:19 - 00:11:03:16
Stacy Rowles:
Yeah, well.


00:11:03:21 - 00:11:08:11
Leonard Feather:
I'm not trying to fool you. I'm just, you know, doing playing things that I think will interest you whether or not you know who they are.


00:11:08:12 - 00:11:10:10
Stacy Rowles:
Is he playing flugelhorn on that or trumpet?


00:11:10:13 - 00:11:13:13
Leonard Feather:
no, I think he always plays trumpet. That's. I don't think I see playing trumpet.


00:11:13:13 - 00:11:15:26
Jimmy Rowles:
I don't think I've ever heard him play another one.


00:11:15:28 - 00:11:16:20
Stacy Rowles:
And that sounded.


00:11:16:20 - 00:11:20:08
Jimmy Rowles:
Real. That's why when you had Art farmers, man there, I knew it wasn't him.


00:11:20:13 - 00:11:21:17
Stacy Rowles:
Yeah. That's right.


00:11:21:17 - 00:11:23:19
Stacy Rowles:
That's kind of hard to me.


00:11:23:21 - 00:11:40:14
Leonard Feather:
Yeah, that's George, I'm sure it's not a foghorn. It just says what? Marsalis trumpet. And that's all I've ever seen him play. Yeah, yeah. Okay, let's listen to record number two.


00:11:40:17 - 00:12:04:13
Unknown Speaker:
Hey hey, hey, hey.

Unknown Speaker:

00:18:25:25 - 00:18:30:14
Leonard Feather:
Okay. That we have record number two. Who wants it? Jimmy Ross. You want to try first?


00:18:30:16 - 00:18:32:12
Jimmy Rowles:
That Roy Haynes?


00:18:32:15 - 00:18:34:21
Leonard Feather:
I'll tell you in a minute.


00:18:34:23 - 00:18:44:13
Jimmy Rowles:
I don't know, I thought of, George, a tenor player in New York. George. Real heavy.


00:18:44:15 - 00:18:45:29
Leonard Feather:
Do you know what you mean? Stacy.


00:18:46:01 - 00:18:46:19
Stacy Rowles:
Coleman.


00:18:46:21 - 00:18:47:02
Leonard Feather:
Josh.


00:18:47:02 - 00:18:58:22
Jimmy Rowles:
Coleman. Coleman. Oh, I thought of him, and I thought of Mobley, and like she said, Dexter. But then the guy got a little bit too involved for Dexter. For me.


00:19:00:14 - 00:19:01:26
Stacy Rowles:
Terrell laid back, and.


00:19:01:28 - 00:19:07:12
Jimmy Rowles:
But he had the laid back sound. By golly, you've got me that. Could that be junior cook?


00:19:07:14 - 00:19:09:28
Leonard Feather:
Well, never mind who it is. What do you think of.


00:19:10:01 - 00:19:11:05
Stacy Rowles:
Oh, I liked it. Yeah.


00:19:11:09 - 00:19:11:26
Stacy Rowles:
Excellent.


00:19:11:26 - 00:19:26:25
Jimmy Rowles:
Yeah, it sounded like a band, like either one of Blakey's new bands, newer bands or, maybe something that,


00:19:29:08 - 00:19:31:13
Stacy Rowles:
first thing, I thought it was Blakey, too.


00:19:31:15 - 00:19:35:28
Jimmy Rowles:
Yeah, a Roy Haynes or, who else?


00:19:35:28 - 00:19:37:17
Leonard Feather:
Did you hear it? Stacy? What'd you think?


00:19:37:24 - 00:19:39:28
Stacy Rowles:
I loved it, I thought it was great. Yeah, I.


00:19:39:28 - 00:19:40:19
Jimmy Rowles:
Liked it, too.


00:19:40:20 - 00:19:42:11
Stacy Rowles:
Yeah, but, Yeah.


00:19:42:14 - 00:19:43:27
Jimmy Rowles:
Excellent, too.


00:19:43:29 - 00:19:45:05
Stacy Rowles:
That kind of, rhythm.


00:19:45:05 - 00:19:45:26
Jimmy Rowles:
Section was good.


00:19:45:26 - 00:19:51:14
Stacy Rowles:
It's a real nice groove. Nice groove. Trumpet player. Have excellent sound. sort of.


00:19:51:14 - 00:19:52:11
Stacy Rowles:
Lee Morgan.


00:19:52:18 - 00:19:53:14
Leonard Feather:
You think it was named Morgan?


00:19:53:17 - 00:19:56:12
Stacy Rowles:
Yeah. Yeah.


00:19:56:14 - 00:20:01:26
Jimmy Rowles:
That's what we first both looked at each other when we first heard it start. I thought of Lee.


00:20:01:29 - 00:20:14:09
Leonard Feather:
Well, I got news for you. Yeah, yeah. You're not. Well, actually, you mentioned one of the people that they're on it. It is a actually. Is it. It is Dexter. Yeah, but it's very old. It's Herbie Hancock's date. He composed it and, played piano on it. And Freddie Hubbard.


00:20:14:11 - 00:20:16:06
Stacy Rowles:
Freddie. That was the actual one, I thought.


00:20:16:06 - 00:20:17:16
Leonard Feather:
But drummer was Billy Higgins.


00:20:17:23 - 00:20:20:23
Stacy Rowles:
It him? Yeah. Freddie tossed around in my head.


00:20:20:23 - 00:20:24:18
Leonard Feather:
Two bass player was Butch Warren. It's a tune called driftin. It's. I think it's.


00:20:24:18 - 00:20:25:07
Stacy Rowles:
Dexter.


00:20:25:13 - 00:20:31:08
Leonard Feather:
It was probably Herbie's very first album as Aledo taken off the record in May 1962.


00:20:31:09 - 00:20:33:00
Jimmy Rowles:
Hancock two.


00:20:33:02 - 00:20:38:00
Leonard Feather:
about the he's mentioned it, though. That's what often happens. You think of something you need to forget to say anything.


00:20:38:00 - 00:20:38:20
Stacy Rowles:
No, actually.


00:20:38:27 - 00:20:40:10
Stacy Rowles:
It sure.


00:20:40:14 - 00:20:45:26
Leonard Feather:
Was. Well, it's very early. That's why 1962. That's an old record. But it still sounds good,


00:20:45:29 - 00:20:46:12
Stacy Rowles:
It sure.


00:20:46:12 - 00:20:47:19
Stacy Rowles:
Sure asked.


00:20:47:22 - 00:20:48:25
Leonard Feather:
Well, I'm glad you enjoyed that.


00:20:48:27 - 00:20:50:02
Stacy Rowles:
Absolutely.


00:20:50:05 - 00:21:07:10
Leonard Feather:
Well, this is Leonard Feather with our guests, Stacey Rose and Jimmy Rose. And as you probably gather by now, they're doing the blindfold test live. This will appear in due course in Downbeat magazine. this next one. I don't have too many doubts about what your reaction will be. I hope it doesn't skip grooves because it's a very, very old record we should now be.


00:21:07:11 - 00:21:14:11
Leonard Feather:
But let's let's see if we can get most of it anyway.


00:21:14:14 - 00:21:27:01
Unknown Speaker:
And ever even if, if, if even if it.


00:21:27:04 - 00:21:33:02
Unknown Speaker:
May be 70, 70, 50, 50.


00:21:33:04 - 00:21:36:01
Unknown Speaker:
50.


00:21:36:03 - 00:21:46:19
Unknown Speaker:
And it it it. It can. Be.


00:21:46:21 - 00:21:50:29
Unknown Speaker:
Anything.


00:21:51:02 - 00:21:57:05
Unknown Speaker:
That's.


00:21:57:07 - 00:22:12:11
Unknown Speaker:
If you.


00:22:12:13 - 00:22:15:02
Unknown Speaker:
If.


00:22:15:05 - 00:22:20:29
Unknown Speaker:
And if it. If.


00:22:21:01 - 00:22:22:21
Unknown Speaker:
And even if.


00:22:22:21 - 00:22:26:12
Unknown Speaker:
It.


00:22:26:15 - 00:22:56:28
Unknown Speaker:
If I mean Mick. Mick. Mick. Mick. Mick. Mick. Mick. Mick. Mick. Mick. Mick.


00:22:57:00 - 00:23:00:23
Unknown Speaker:
And it.


00:23:00:25 - 00:23:05:05
Unknown Speaker:
May be. And and.


00:23:05:07 - 00:23:11:22
Unknown Speaker:
It. And then.


00:23:11:24 - 00:23:20:26
Unknown Speaker:
And. And and and.


00:23:20:28 - 00:23:23:10
Unknown Speaker:
Maybe.


00:23:23:12 - 00:23:33:05
Unknown Speaker:
It's. Mimi. Mimi. Mimi. Mimi. Mimi. Mimi. Mimi. Mimi. Mimi. Mimi. Mimi. Mimi. Mimi.


00:23:33:08 - 00:23:40:03
Unknown Speaker:
Her baby.


00:23:40:05 - 00:23:53:03
Unknown Speaker:
Baby. And that's specific. That's that's. That's.


00:23:53:05 - 00:24:00:11
Leonard Feather:
Well, we're like. It didn't skip grooves after all. You got the whole thing that Stacey set familiar to you.


00:24:00:13 - 00:24:18:22
Stacy Rowles:
I think the last part, the very ending of it. I really strongly thought of Louie. It's. I think that's, I wish that kind of sound and feeling was still here. You know, I feel like I missed out on a whole bunch of stuff back then.


00:24:18:24 - 00:24:19:06
Stacy Rowles:
Yeah.


00:24:19:10 - 00:24:21:17
Stacy Rowles:
Boy, I love it. I this is great.


00:24:21:23 - 00:24:22:26
Leonard Feather:
How about the piano?


00:24:22:28 - 00:24:31:04
Stacy Rowles:
Piano player? I, I don't know, dad kind of threw out a couple of names, and I, I couldn't tell you. I loved it, though. It was great. That whole style was just great.


00:24:31:08 - 00:24:32:13
Leonard Feather:
Any writing?


00:24:32:15 - 00:24:34:10
Stacy Rowles:
Oh, God.


00:24:34:13 - 00:24:35:13
Leonard Feather:
The maximum is fine.


00:24:35:14 - 00:24:38:11
Stacy Rowles:
Well, I would go all the way. Five stars. Yeah, absolutely.


00:24:38:13 - 00:24:39:19
Leonard Feather:
Jimmy.


00:24:39:22 - 00:24:40:20
Jimmy Rowles:
I go five.


00:24:40:24 - 00:24:41:17
Stacy Rowles:
Yeah.


00:24:41:19 - 00:24:42:21
Jimmy Rowles:
I was Louie and Earl.


00:24:44:28 - 00:24:46:06
Leonard Feather:
do you know what. Right.


00:24:46:09 - 00:24:50:27
Jimmy Rowles:
Well I don't know I don't know I've never heard of that record. I never heard him play that.


00:24:51:00 - 00:24:51:29
Stacy Rowles:
Yeah.


00:24:52:01 - 00:24:55:15
Leonard Feather:
Well. Well what a particularly appealed to you about it.


00:24:55:17 - 00:25:06:04
Jimmy Rowles:
Well I like the feeling. And that was when, Earl was getting away from, too much of running and notes together and getting into the octaves stuff.


00:25:06:04 - 00:25:06:29
Stacy Rowles:
And,


00:25:07:01 - 00:25:20:14
Jimmy Rowles:
Yeah, the things that attracted me to him, like when I started buying his Decca records and the things he did with Louis. Yeah. Where he was, as he said, he was trying to play more like a horn.


00:25:20:16 - 00:25:21:11
Stacy Rowles:
Yeah.


00:25:21:13 - 00:25:38:17
Jimmy Rowles:
You know, like some of those solos he put down on some of those records when the band all of a sudden the band would stop and he would play and he would play those octaves and by he make his stand up in your chair.


00:25:38:19 - 00:25:39:11
Stacy Rowles:
Yeah.


00:25:39:14 - 00:25:42:27
Jimmy Rowles:
Because I had never heard anybody play the piano like that. Yeah.


00:25:43:00 - 00:25:45:17
Leonard Feather:
How about your early reactions to Louis?


00:25:45:19 - 00:25:49:23
Jimmy Rowles:
Oh, I like I loved everything I ever heard Louis play.


00:25:49:26 - 00:26:10:14
Leonard Feather:
That's great. Well, you're right, of course that's who it is. It's actually, I think it's the only duo record that Louis and Earl ever made. It's a tune called Weather Bird, written by King Oliver, who was Louis, his mentor. As you know, it was recorded. You wouldn't believe this. 1928. Wow. How about that? For a record is almost 60 years old and it sounds as fresh and exciting as it did the day they recorded it.


00:26:10:15 - 00:26:11:12
Stacy Rowles:
That's great.


00:26:11:14 - 00:26:12:14
Stacy Rowles:
Yeah, right.


00:26:12:17 - 00:26:22:18
Leonard Feather:
That's a nice experience for Stacey to be exposed to that for the first time. It's not funny. Yeah. There's an album called Louis and Earl. All the great things added together, you know, like West and Blues and so forth.


00:26:22:20 - 00:26:24:08
Jimmy Rowles:
And they still have a Louis on there.


00:26:24:11 - 00:26:26:08
Leonard Feather:
No, that's a bit later. Yeah.


00:26:26:10 - 00:26:29:22
Jimmy Rowles:
That's a great record thing on that. This. Yeah. That was fantastic. It.


00:26:29:24 - 00:26:51:20
Leonard Feather:
No this one has a basin street blues and the one I just played Weather bird. Muggles. Saint James infirmary. Squeeze me sugar, mister. It's a beautiful Mr. Louis Armstrong story, volume three, in case you want to get it. Stacey, give it to your father for birthday. Present. Yeah, we're doing nicely. Yeah. That's, I had a feeling that you would both enjoy that.


00:26:51:20 - 00:27:31:13
Leonard Feather:
And I also had a feeling that Stacey would know the piano player. Anyhow, let's go on with a record number four.


00:27:31:15 - 00:27:46:11
Unknown Speaker:
And.


00:27:46:14 - 00:28:00:05
Unknown Speaker:
I'm just.


00:28:00:07 - 00:28:38:25
Unknown Speaker:
In.


00:28:38:28 - 00:28:58:24
Unknown Speaker:
Some.


00:28:58:26 - 00:30:55:19
Unknown Speaker:
Strange.


00:30:55:22 - 00:31:02:13
Unknown Speaker:
Humor.


00:31:02:15 - 00:31:17:21
Unknown Speaker:
For me.


00:31:38:00 - 00:31:39:28
Leonard Feather:
Okay, how about that one?


00:31:40:00 - 00:31:57:27
Stacy Rowles:
Well, I was definitely dizzy and no doubt. yeah, but as far as the piano player or the bass player, I don't know, I thought maybe it might be Major Holley on bass, but only for a fleeting moment. I liked it, though. It was great.


00:31:57:27 - 00:31:58:06
Stacy Rowles:
I mean.


00:31:58:09 - 00:32:04:03
Leonard Feather:
What you said was early dizzy, I late dizzy in between on.


00:32:04:06 - 00:32:09:08
Stacy Rowles:
Maybe in between to later. in between the late hours.


00:32:09:08 - 00:32:10:15
Leonard Feather:
It changed over the years.


00:32:10:17 - 00:32:38:17
Stacy Rowles:
Well, I think he was a little more, precise in his notes earlier. You know, as we all are. And, the longer you play and the more you play, and, pretty soon the ideas happen, but the notes aren't quite as precise as they used to be. Yeah. but I still love his feel. He's got a great feel.


00:32:38:19 - 00:32:42:02
Stacy Rowles:
That's great. His attitude is great. He's great attitude.


00:32:42:04 - 00:32:43:04
Leonard Feather:
How would you rate it.


00:32:43:06 - 00:32:47:21
Stacy Rowles:
Oh five stars just for him I mean for you know.


00:32:47:24 - 00:32:50:04
Leonard Feather:
Jimmy come on in there.


00:32:50:07 - 00:33:06:14
Jimmy Rowles:
Well I agree with her. And I would just try and pick out who the pianist was because his his dexterity was very good. and, I don't know who he was, but he was is he had a nice, touch, especially on his solos.


00:33:07:22 - 00:33:26:22
Jimmy Rowles:
And, the bass player. It was either the hall they were in, the concert hall made his bass ring a little bit longer. Yeah, I think he usually it sound, isn't it? It made his sound seem a little bit longer than it naturally is. So it makes it very hard to pick out who it was.


00:33:26:25 - 00:33:30:05
Leonard Feather:
That's true. not the greatest recording.


00:33:30:12 - 00:33:34:09
Jimmy Rowles:
No. It is. Do you think it was grandeur?


00:33:34:11 - 00:33:36:27
Leonard Feather:
Telling a moment? Do you want to write it out of.


00:33:37:01 - 00:33:39:15
Jimmy Rowles:
Oh, I'd, I'd give it a very high rating.


00:33:40:10 - 00:33:41:20
Jimmy Rowles:
I think that was a good record.


00:33:41:23 - 00:33:56:18
Leonard Feather:
Okay. Well it was dizzy with a well known team at Mitchell on rough track Mitchell on piano. Oh Willie Rough also plays French horn but is best known as a bass player. And that was a concert they did not too long ago I guess. Playing of course. Love for sale. Yeah it was so it was very recent.


00:33:56:18 - 00:33:59:13
Leonard Feather:
I don't know the exact date but certainly.


00:33:59:16 - 00:34:01:22
Jimmy Rowles:
Do I could like is very fine.


00:34:02:22 - 00:34:04:25
Jimmy Rowles:
And so it was the both of them are.


00:34:05:18 - 00:34:21:08
Leonard Feather:
Yeah I'm wrong. It wasn't release. It was released recently. It was recorded live at Dartmouth College in 1970. So I guess it just discovered it. So Stacy, you're right when you said middle period, it's not, you know, not contemporaries also not very early. So Blackheart Records, just newly released on that label.


00:34:21:11 - 00:34:23:12
Stacy Rowles:
That's a real nice label. They're coming out with some release.


00:34:23:13 - 00:35:04:18
Leonard Feather:
Yeah. Doing some good things. Yeah. Okay. We have time for I think. I hope three more records is one of them.


00:35:04:20 - 00:35:11:14
Unknown Speaker:
And I.


00:35:11:17 - 00:35:17:17
Unknown Speaker:
See that?


00:35:17:19 - 00:35:26:28

Unknown Speaker:
Be.


00:40:21:15 - 00:40:25:02
Leonard Feather:
Okay. Do you want to take this one first? Jimmy.


00:40:25:05 - 00:40:34:21
Jimmy Rowles:
Well, at first I started thinking about Stan Getz. I started thinking about Stan Getz, and then I didn't know for sure.


00:40:34:23 - 00:40:36:12
Leonard Feather:
And then you stop thinking about Stan Getz.


00:40:36:12 - 00:40:38:28
Stacy Rowles:
Yeah, and I stop.


00:40:39:00 - 00:40:47:24
Jimmy Rowles:
Then I started thinking about Freddie Hubbard for a while, and then I stopped and. And I started thinking about Liebert. Lombardo and I quit.


00:40:50:24 - 00:41:05:24
Jimmy Rowles:
And and I thought, oh, Woody Shaw. And then I thought of Ronnie Matthews, and I thought, of the different pianists, I remember I heard New York. I even thought of Joanne Back Keane for a minute.


00:41:07:07 - 00:41:15:19
Jimmy Rowles:
But, I really don't know who it was. I enjoyed the record, though, very much. I did. I played very well.


00:41:16:23 - 00:41:21:08
Jimmy Rowles:
But, I kept my mind, kept going back to Stan.


00:41:21:10 - 00:41:24:01
Leonard Feather:
That's strange. Well, all right, Stacy.


00:41:24:04 - 00:41:45:23
Stacy Rowles:
Yeah, I enjoyed it a lot, too. I thought it was very good, but I couldn't I couldn't pick out any individual players on on the record. I went from person to person trying to pick out some similarities and little nuances that I've sort of recognize from different players. And, the only thing I could come up with was some sort of a the saxophone player had a sound that reminded me of Stan Getz.


00:41:45:25 - 00:41:48:03
Stacy Rowles:
but that's about the only thing really I could come up with is.


00:41:48:03 - 00:41:49:29
Stacy Rowles:
I'd be one of.


00:41:50:01 - 00:41:52:00
Stacy Rowles:
The instrumentalists, but I liked it a lot.


00:41:52:00 - 00:41:52:19
Leonard Feather:
So rating.


00:41:52:20 - 00:41:54:27
Stacy Rowles:
Rate for stars.


00:41:54:27 - 00:41:56:07
Stacy Rowles:
I guess for.


00:41:56:09 - 00:42:13:27
Leonard Feather:
Both for okay, that's the first I have ever heard Stan Getz confused with Hank Mobley. That guy was. His name was Hank Mobley's date, and he wrote the tune. It's called, straight, No Filter. And, McCoy Tyner on piano. Lee Morgan, one of your favorite trumpet players. Stacy I'm surprised.


00:42:14:00 - 00:42:23:09
Stacy Rowles:
I that thought I went from Charles la to trombone. I try to figure out who does that sound like. Yeah. And yeah, it was. I couldn't pick out anything.


00:42:23:09 - 00:42:25:28
Jimmy Rowles:
So hard to put them all together. Separate.


00:42:25:28 - 00:42:27:02
Stacy Rowles:
Nothing special.


00:42:27:02 - 00:42:42:00
Leonard Feather:
It's an old as is 1966, I think. And, Lee motor fact Hank Mobley was the lead at McCoy Tyner. Bob Conch on bass. You mentioned him on an early record when it wasn't a match. this time it was. And again, Billy Higgins on drums. Well, the main thing is you enjoyed it.


00:42:42:02 - 00:42:44:23
Stacy Rowles:
I haven't heard Hank Mobley too much.


00:42:44:25 - 00:42:48:00
Leonard Feather:
Well, he, he died not long ago. As you probably know.


00:42:48:07 - 00:42:48:24
Jimmy Rowles:
I do not.


00:42:48:24 - 00:42:50:03
Leonard Feather:
Usually. And,


00:42:50:05 - 00:42:52:29
Jimmy Rowles:
I heard a couple of records he made with, Miles.


00:42:53:06 - 00:42:56:28
Stacy Rowles:
He plays beautiful, beautiful, really beautiful player. Of course, everybody.


00:42:57:05 - 00:42:57:16
Stacy Rowles:
Plays.


00:42:57:18 - 00:42:59:29
Stacy Rowles:
Great. So great.


00:43:00:04 - 00:43:10:09
Leonard Feather:
I think we're going to get two more records. And he one of them.


00:43:10:12 - 00:43:42:23
Unknown Speaker:
I'm not a fan of. I'm not a fan of.


00:43:51:15 - 00:45:51:01
Unknown Speaker:
And and and and.


00:45:51:04 - 00:46:00:13
Unknown Speaker:
I'm.


00:46:00:15 - 00:46:37:03
Unknown Speaker:
I'm. I'm.


00:46:37:06 - 00:46:50:14
Unknown Speaker:
And I've never been in.


00:46:50:17 - 00:46:51:26
Stacy Rowles:
Well, I.


00:46:51:28 - 00:46:53:27
Leonard Feather:
I grew up a little. Stacey, I think you have an idea.


00:46:53:28 - 00:46:57:18
Stacy Rowles:
Dad's going. He's waving flags at me. He wants to go first.


00:46:57:19 - 00:46:59:04
Leonard Feather:
Oh, okay, dad, you go first.


00:46:59:09 - 00:47:00:21
Jimmy Rowles:
I say Ruby Braff.


00:47:02:11 - 00:47:06:10
Jimmy Rowles:
Dave McKenna. Haggard. Jack Hanna.


00:47:06:12 - 00:47:09:04
Leonard Feather:
No, I'll tell you something. It's that era.


00:47:09:06 - 00:47:16:07
Stacy Rowles:
Yeah, it's definitely Ruby Braff. It can't be anybody else. McKenna on piano. I'm almost positive.


00:47:16:09 - 00:47:18:16
Jimmy Rowles:
I'm not sure about Bob Haggard.


00:47:18:18 - 00:47:23:01
Leonard Feather:
How about opinions? Oh, you know, the guessing is secondary.


00:47:23:03 - 00:47:27:28
Jimmy Rowles:
yeah. Well, we could get into the guessing and you forget about that. Yeah. No, I think it was very well played.


00:47:29:04 - 00:47:30:08
Jimmy Rowles:
Very well played.


00:47:30:11 - 00:47:35:19
Leonard Feather:
It's a different sort of a different groove from what we've been playing up till now. It sort of pretty much of the traditional.


00:47:35:25 - 00:47:36:21
Stacy Rowles:
Yeah. Okay.


00:47:36:21 - 00:47:38:08
Jimmy Rowles:
Well played I, I like it.


00:47:38:08 - 00:47:40:11
Leonard Feather:
Do you relate to that kind of thing Stacy.


00:47:40:11 - 00:47:44:25
Stacy Rowles:
Oh yeah. Absolutely. That's you know it's more melodic to me. It flows through change.


00:47:44:28 - 00:47:47:08
Jimmy Rowles:
All kinds of music. It allows you can relate to it.


00:47:47:11 - 00:47:48:26
Stacy Rowles:
And it's happy. It's


00:47:48:28 - 00:47:49:22
Jimmy Rowles:
Yeah, very.


00:47:49:26 - 00:47:54:25
Stacy Rowles:
Very happy. And and great I love it. It's I love it.


00:47:54:27 - 00:47:58:24
Leonard Feather:
Well, I'm glad you liked it. Well, ready anybody?


00:47:58:27 - 00:48:00:02
Stacy Rowles:
I go five star.


00:48:00:02 - 00:48:01:21
Jimmy Rowles:
I'll give it five.


00:48:01:23 - 00:48:03:00
Stacy Rowles:
You both give a five.


00:48:03:03 - 00:48:04:29
Leonard Feather:
Easy. I think Jackie Cooper will be very happy.


00:48:05:00 - 00:48:10:28
Stacy Rowles:
Oh, no. Oh, no. Yeah, we.


00:48:11:00 - 00:48:12:23
Leonard Feather:
Were talking about Jackie. Come before the show.


00:48:12:26 - 00:48:13:29
Stacy Rowles:
Remember that.


00:48:14:01 - 00:48:23:03
Leonard Feather:
He is a big sir based trumpet player. Flugelhorn, I should say. He doesn't play trumpet. He plays flugelhorn. And that might have tipped you off, you know. Yeah, because Ruby breathless cornet.


00:48:23:06 - 00:48:23:23
Stacy Rowles:
Yeah.


00:48:23:29 - 00:48:25:05
Jimmy Rowles:
And you know what? I kept waiting.


00:48:25:05 - 00:48:36:23
Leonard Feather:
For the rhythm section. Los Angeles musicians Johnny Vero on piano and Estes on drums and David Stone on bass. And it's an album by Jackie Kuhn that just came out recent called Jazz and Iran.


00:48:36:23 - 00:48:37:13
Stacy Rowles:
It's a brand new.


00:48:37:13 - 00:48:42:24
Leonard Feather:
Album, and I think I can well relate to your reaction because, you know, Ruby Braff, as you know, plays that same kind of music.


00:48:42:24 - 00:48:50:22
Jimmy Rowles:
And, you know, the thing that made me that I missed in the trumpet was the intersperse all of different songs like Ruby does.


00:48:50:22 - 00:48:51:28
Leonard Feather:
Oh yeah, the quotes.


00:48:52:06 - 00:49:00:11
Jimmy Rowles:
I kept waiting for quotes, other songs. Well, I guess Ruby just decided to play this one straight because he's sure it's it's sure sounded like him.


00:49:00:11 - 00:49:03:03
Stacy Rowles:
It sounded like Johnny Bar on piano, too.


00:49:03:06 - 00:49:04:18
Jimmy Rowles:
oh. I'm not familiar with his playing.


00:49:04:18 - 00:49:06:10
Leonard Feather:
Yeah, he's very good.


00:49:06:12 - 00:49:08:15
Stacy Rowles:
But he's got a sound.


00:49:08:15 - 00:49:09:26
Jimmy Rowles:
He can get over those keys.


00:49:09:26 - 00:49:10:21
Stacy Rowles:
Yeah.


00:49:10:23 - 00:49:16:29
Leonard Feather:
Well, that's funny. I was kind of glad I did that because I think I got to tell, Jackie, come to listen to the show, because.


00:49:17:01 - 00:49:17:11
Jimmy Rowles:
Yeah, he's.


00:49:17:11 - 00:49:18:10
Leonard Feather:
Going to get a big kick out of.


00:49:18:10 - 00:49:19:22
Jimmy Rowles:
That. I really enjoyed that.


00:49:19:25 - 00:49:20:08
Stacy Rowles:
All right.


00:49:20:08 - 00:49:56:21
Leonard Feather:
And now, as I say, for something completely different.


00:49:56:23 - 00:50:10:00
Unknown Speaker:
If you.


00:50:10:02 - 00:51:15:10
Unknown Speaker:
Never.


00:51:15:13 - 00:51:22:07

Unknown Speaker:

Unknown Speaker:
Do I.


00:53:31:28 - 00:53:55:17
Unknown Speaker:
One more time.


00:53:55:19 - 00:54:03:01
Leonard Feather:
All right. That was, final record for the day. And our blindfolds. So Jimmy and Stacy rose. Jimmy.


00:54:03:03 - 00:54:30:24
Jimmy Rowles:
Well, once is enough for me. some guy with a big band that's playing the. What do they call it, fusion or synthesizers and all that kind of stuff, you know? And, and, I don't it's not my bag at all. Yeah, I like I appreciate it was well played. I give all of of the people playing it full credit.


00:54:30:26 - 00:54:37:04
Jimmy Rowles:
They played the hell out of it. But it's just not my style, that's all. Yeah. So I have. That's all I can say about.


00:54:37:07 - 00:54:37:17
Leonard Feather:
Yeah.


00:54:37:18 - 00:54:39:03
Jimmy Rowles:
Stays very well played.


00:54:39:06 - 00:54:57:20
Stacy Rowles:
Yeah, I liked it. I thought it was good. You know, I, I definitely reminded me of Miles because he's the only one that's doing that kind of stuff now. But it was, I liked it. I mean, it's, not my favorite kind of music, but,


00:54:57:23 - 00:54:59:23
Leonard Feather:
It's not the kind of music that you would want to be involved in.


00:55:00:02 - 00:55:11:07
Stacy Rowles:
No. Not really. No. It's, I don't know. I would call it funk music myself. Yeah. which sort of falls more into a category of R&B rather than jazz.


00:55:11:11 - 00:55:11:29
Stacy Rowles:
Yeah.


00:55:12:01 - 00:55:26:09
Stacy Rowles:
But, it's selling jazz records and it's making people listen to jazz radio stations and maybe. So, I'm all for it. You know, I love all kinds of music, all diversities and. Oh, yeah, my own personal taste is my own.


00:55:26:11 - 00:55:28:08
Jimmy Rowles:
Put it down. I just was saying.


00:55:28:10 - 00:55:30:03
Leonard Feather:
Listen, your personal opinion is of mosque.


00:55:30:03 - 00:55:34:19
Stacy Rowles:
And I thought it was. It sounded good. I mean, it was a nice, nice feeling.


00:55:34:22 - 00:55:37:26
Leonard Feather:
What would you give it around three. Three is good to is fair for. It's very good.


00:55:37:29 - 00:55:44:17
Stacy Rowles:
Well it would be hard to rate. You know, just in my own personal opinion, I would probably give it three, three and a half, you know, four star.


00:55:44:19 - 00:55:45:11
Jimmy Rowles:
in there.


00:55:45:14 - 00:55:47:20
Stacy Rowles:
I'm just, you know.


00:55:47:22 - 00:55:48:29
Jimmy Rowles:
Very well done.


00:55:49:02 - 00:56:02:27
Leonard Feather:
Yeah. Okay. Well, it was Miles Davis. His new album just came out recently. The album is called to to that particular track was called perfect Way. What interested me is the fact that Jimmy described as a big band. Actually it's not. It's just Miles with a synthesizer sound.


00:56:03:00 - 00:56:08:06
Jimmy Rowles:
That's what I mean. It's more or less all I hear was sympathy or resistance.


00:56:09:10 - 00:56:12:23
Jimmy Rowles:
Well, I guess flying pictures with three people now?


00:56:12:26 - 00:56:15:18
Stacy Rowles:
yeah. Well, it's.


00:56:15:20 - 00:56:20:03
Leonard Feather:
It's been a great pleasure having you here. I hope you enjoyed going through this ordeal.


00:56:20:05 - 00:56:21:26
Stacy Rowles:
And, it was very interesting.


00:56:21:26 - 00:56:23:01
Stacy Rowles:
Very interesting. Yeah.


00:56:23:03 - 00:56:38:05
Leonard Feather:
I'd like to do it again. I think I'll do some more blindfold tests on the air, because a lot of musicians don't mind expressing their opinions honestly as as you did. And it's really fun to do it. Thank you so much, Tracy Rose. Thank you, Jimmy Rose. We'll be looking for you at some of the local clubs in the near future, I'm sure.


00:56:38:05 - 00:56:39:21
Stacy Rowles:
Yeah. Thank you. Keep your.


00:56:39:21 - 00:56:45:16
Leonard Feather:
Eyes out. So till next week, this is Leonard Feather saying thanks again to our guests. So long for now. And thank you for being here.


00:56:45:16 - 00:56:59:17
Jimmy Rowles:
Thank you very much.


00:56:59:19 - 00:58:09:16
Leonard Feather:

Leonard Feather:

00:58:51:28 - 00:59:16:01
Leonard Feather:
And once again, greetings and modulations. This is Leonard Feather bringing you an hour of jazz. And I'm very happy to have with me today two distinguished guests, one of the rare father and daughter teams. One of the very few, I suppose, in jazz history. on my immediate, not left or right there, directly across to me at the table is Miss Stacy Rose, who is a very, very talented virtuoso.


00:59:16:03 - 00:59:18:26
Leonard Feather:
Is that the right word? Virtuoso? I was a little going.


00:59:18:27 - 00:59:20:18
Stacy Rowles:
In the feminine version. Yeah.


00:59:20:21 - 00:59:38:19
Leonard Feather:
So Stacey Rose and, at her left is an old friend of mine whom we knew in the New York days. And we've known better in the California days, a great pianist and composer, Jimmy Rose. And I say, come on. And, Jimmy, are you want to finish your lunch for us?


00:59:38:21 - 00:59:40:13
Jimmy Rowles:
No. I'm okay.


00:59:40:15 - 01:00:05:03
Leonard Feather:
Okay. I, would like to point out, as if most of you didn't already know that Jimmy and Stacey have been working together in recent years, and that, to me, has been a source of great pleasure. I don't know how exactly it came about, but which which of you would like to tell the story? But let's this that Stacey talk about it first because how you began playing well.


01:00:05:05 - 01:00:27:12
Stacy Rowles:
I started playing piano when I was very young, maybe five, 4 or 5 years old, and I started taking piano lessons, and I liked it, but I, I guess I just couldn't relate to it too well. It was something I just didn't feel comfortable with it. And, I guess I felt that the pressure earlier or something, I didn't realize it.


01:00:27:14 - 01:00:46:19
Stacy Rowles:
And then I started playing the drums when I was in junior high school. no. Elementary school. I'm sorry. I played the field drum over the shoulder in the band. And then one day I was looking for something in dad's dresser, and I found a trumpet in the bottom drawer of the dresser, and I said, what's this? And he said, it's a trumpet.


01:00:46:19 - 01:01:05:17
Stacy Rowles:
And I said, well, how do you play it? And he showed me how to make a sound on it, and he showed me the chromatic scale. And then I used to come in and steal it and take it up in the attic and toot and honk, and I'm surprised I didn't throw me out of the house. Then. And then I got into junior high school and really enjoyed it and got into the band and came home and said, well, guess what?


01:01:05:17 - 01:01:11:23
Stacy Rowles:
And I made the band. It was last year, third trumpet out of about 15 trumpet players.


01:01:11:25 - 01:01:17:09
Leonard Feather:
Jimmy, perhaps you can take it up and then explain how she came to switch to flugelhorn from trumpet?


01:01:17:11 - 01:01:47:02
Jimmy Rowles:
Well, she'd been playing the trumpet sometime in. She heard, evidently heard, flugelhorn and either on a record or in person, probably on a record. And, her birthday was coming up and she left a little note by my side of the bed said, dear dad, if you buy me a flugelhorn for my birthday, I will play the you know what out of it.


01:01:47:04 - 01:01:51:07
Leonard Feather:
Yeah, I, I just self-censor that one word Bleep.


01:01:51:09 - 01:01:51:23
Stacy Rowles:
Yeah.


01:01:51:23 - 01:01:55:18
Jimmy Rowles:
So, I bought a car. I bought the car and she wanted.


01:01:56:07 - 01:01:58:04
Jimmy Rowles:
Quinn on.


01:01:58:07 - 01:01:59:04
Leonard Feather:
And it went from there.


01:01:59:09 - 01:02:08:01
Jimmy Rowles:
And then she went on down to thing and where was that Orange Coast College. Orange Coast College where they had 75 bands.


01:02:08:05 - 01:02:09:18
Stacy Rowles:
Yeah, it was a big jazz festival.


01:02:09:18 - 01:02:32:15
Jimmy Rowles:
Great big monstrosity thing. And they had the judges were all from, from, around Los Angeles, and they didn't know who she was. And they had, they gave her a first prize for, soloist out of all the musicians. And guess what? The first prize was a queen on flugelhorn. she got to you.


01:02:32:17 - 01:02:34:11
Stacy Rowles:
That's wonderful.


01:02:34:13 - 01:02:50:05
Leonard Feather:
I know a lot more of the stars in that, but we'll be getting into that later in the show. Meanwhile, is something very topical I wanted to talk about because, as we all know, there's a wonderful movie just coming out now called Around Midnight with Dexter Gordon in the leading acting part. Herbie Hancock wrote the music and also has an acting part.


01:02:50:05 - 01:03:02:03
Leonard Feather:
And all these other great musicians are in. And also on the soundtrack is one of Jimmy Rose's compositions, and I think we should get around to Jimmy Rose, the composer, and talk a little about that.


01:03:02:06 - 01:03:03:02
Jimmy Rowles:
the peacocks.


01:03:03:05 - 01:03:04:09
Leonard Feather:
Yeah.


01:03:04:11 - 01:03:20:07
Jimmy Rowles:
Well, I've been listening to the, there's a set of records. It, features the music of the Africa's, the pygmies. And, what is that label? I never forget it. It's something like narrow. Sorry, that's not it.


01:03:20:10 - 01:03:21:02
Leonard Feather:
Do you know Stacey?


01:03:21:08 - 01:03:21:28
Stacy Rowles:
No, I can't.


01:03:22:02 - 01:03:28:09
Jimmy Rowles:
Anyway, it's, the music of the Belgian Congo pygmies.


01:03:29:01 - 01:03:30:23
Stacy Rowles:
No graphic?


01:03:30:25 - 01:04:06:28
Jimmy Rowles:
No, that's not it. But anyway, it's, it's a very. It had sent you had to send away for the series, and I sent for them. It's about five records. And, I've been listening to these records. All these tribes singing. And the one from the Belgian Congo with pygmies. That lady was singing her little baby to sleep and all the music the way they did it, you know, and everything was stuck with me, and, and it was inspiring me and all and, and and, just one day, I just wrote this song, the peacocks.


01:04:07:04 - 01:04:14:25
Jimmy Rowles:
And I wrote another one that same week. I call that one, The Pygmies, which I recorded with Buster Williams back east.


01:04:15:02 - 01:04:16:07
Stacy Rowles:
Yeah.


01:04:16:10 - 01:04:46:10
Jimmy Rowles:
But the peacocks, I just happened to I played it every now and then when I was playing in New York, nothing seemed to happen to much. It was just a ballad, you know, a kind of a weird, different type song and, lullaby in a way. Yeah. And I never I just named it The Peacocks because I was spur of the moment and one trying for any kind of a Hottentot title.


01:04:46:12 - 01:04:46:27
Stacy Rowles:
You know?


01:04:47:04 - 01:04:56:19
Jimmy Rowles:
And, Aria and I played it. I made a record. It was Stan Getz. He asked me if I had anything original, and I told I played it for him and he liked it.


01:04:56:19 - 01:05:01:04
Leonard Feather:
And so I, you know, was involved with the making of the movie in some way.


01:05:01:07 - 01:05:01:18
Stacy Rowles:
Pardon me.


01:05:01:21 - 01:05:02:27
Leonard Feather:
And we ran out his it was.


01:05:02:27 - 01:05:03:27
Stacy Rowles:
A very.


01:05:04:00 - 01:05:05:12
Leonard Feather:
Yes sort of promoter. Right.


01:05:05:12 - 01:05:08:23
Jimmy Rowles:
Well, he's very a close friend of, Bertrand.


01:05:08:25 - 01:05:09:26
Leonard Feather:
Tavernier who made the.


01:05:09:26 - 01:05:22:20
Jimmy Rowles:
Movie about. Yes, exactly. Yeah. And, they were together and, he played this record and, Tavernier thought it was he just fell in love with it, and he insisted that it was in the picture.


01:05:22:22 - 01:05:23:10
Leonard Feather:
That's wonderful.


01:05:23:10 - 01:05:24:18
Jimmy Rowles:
And that's why it happened.


01:05:24:21 - 01:05:40:10
Leonard Feather:
because it is available on the soundtrack album from Edmonton Midnight, which I recommend everybody, but I would like to play the original version that you made with Stan Getz. Title number of the. So shall we listen to that? Sure. Jimmy Rose, the peacocks with Stan Getz, who else is on it?


01:05:40:13 - 01:05:42:19
Jimmy Rowles:
Elvin Jones and Buster Williams.


01:05:42:25 - 01:06:03:06
Leonard Feather:
Not a bad from the section. Okay, here we go.


01:06:03:08 - 01:06:21:20
Unknown Speaker:
Tell me. Affordable. Oh, hey.


01:06:21:23 - 01:06:26:06

Unknown Speaker:
Hey.


01:11:23:07 - 01:11:25:26
Leonard Feather:
Hi. That is a beautiful tune to me.


01:11:25:28 - 01:11:26:26
Jimmy Rowles:
Thank you.


01:11:26:28 - 01:11:29:04
Leonard Feather:
Oh, yes. And it says if.


01:11:29:06 - 01:11:34:10
Stacy Rowles:
You can just imagine a whole bunch of peacocks parading by this. Great.


01:11:34:12 - 01:11:42:16
Leonard Feather:
That. Of course, as I said, that was used in the movie around midnight. And that is a movie everybody should see. You seen? I'm just saying. Yeah. You don't sing it.


01:11:42:18 - 01:11:43:12
Stacy Rowles:
Yeah.


01:11:43:14 - 01:11:45:19
Stacy Rowles:
I liked it. I thought Dexter was excellent.


01:11:45:23 - 01:11:48:20
Leonard Feather:
Oh, Dexter Gordon turns out to be a remarkable actor. That's.


01:11:48:20 - 01:11:52:25
Jimmy Rowles:
He really did. I was very surprised. Were very good.


01:11:52:28 - 01:11:55:19
Leonard Feather:
And I think the whole thing has such a good mood.


01:11:55:23 - 01:11:58:00
Jimmy Rowles:
Everyone. Yes.


01:11:58:02 - 01:12:06:29
Leonard Feather:
Anyhow, move back to your back on Jimmy. I don't know. I'm probably starting the wrong thing by talking about you as a composer. You were playing a long time before your composing, I guess.


01:12:07:01 - 01:12:08:16
Jimmy Rowles:
Yes.


01:12:08:18 - 01:12:10:13
Leonard Feather:
where did you. Where are you from? Spokane.


01:12:10:16 - 01:12:11:25
Jimmy Rowles:
Spokane?


01:12:11:28 - 01:12:13:18
Leonard Feather:
Probably when you came down here.


01:12:13:20 - 01:12:15:21
Jimmy Rowles:
0I2 about 21.


01:12:17:16 - 01:12:20:04
Leonard Feather:
Who gave you the, the original impetus.


01:12:20:06 - 01:12:21:12
Jimmy Rowles:
Marshall Ryle.


01:12:21:15 - 01:12:24:07
Leonard Feather:
Oh really. I thought it was Ben Webster. He also was in.


01:12:24:09 - 01:12:29:27
Jimmy Rowles:
he had a lot of influence on me in Seattle.


01:12:30:28 - 01:12:47:29
Jimmy Rowles:
But I went backstage, the Orpheum Theater in Spokane. And, I got the nerve to there was a piano there, and I said, can I play something for you? Any. He said, well, you better get out of this part of the country.


01:12:48:01 - 01:12:57:00
Leonard Feather:
Well, that's probably pretty good advice for anybody that wants to really make it, because, if you'd stayed in Spokane, nothing might have happened.


01:12:57:03 - 01:13:01:07
Jimmy Rowles:
No, there's nothing in Spokane if you're going to try to advance.


01:13:01:10 - 01:13:03:03
Leonard Feather:
So I guess it's the same as it was then.


01:13:03:03 - 01:13:10:13
Jimmy Rowles:
From a beautiful place to grow up, beautiful city. So nice people. But music.


01:13:10:16 - 01:13:12:15
Stacy Rowles:
Yeah.


01:13:12:18 - 01:13:26:02
Leonard Feather:
Let's, let's play another composition of yours. we'll go with the fog if you later on. But this is an Albert the two of you made together. At least Stacy's on part of it. And the title is so good. What's the story about that title? Stacy?


01:13:26:04 - 01:13:28:24
Stacy Rowles:
No, it's just a nickname for me. He started calling me.


01:13:29:01 - 01:13:30:15
Leonard Feather:
Oh. As soon. Oh, I didn't realize.


01:13:30:15 - 01:13:33:04
Stacy Rowles:
Yeah, he started calling me. Used to go when I was really young.


01:13:33:06 - 01:13:35:02
Stacy Rowles:
Oh, and,


01:13:35:05 - 01:13:43:22
Stacy Rowles:
And then one day, not too long ago, he just said, I wrote a song for you. I called it's Too good. Oh. That's nice. In fact, the first time I ever played it was on the recording session.


01:13:43:26 - 01:13:44:09
Leonard Feather:
Really?


01:13:44:11 - 01:13:45:05
Stacy Rowles:
Yeah.


01:13:45:08 - 01:13:47:15
Leonard Feather:
And I really like this. This is actually the. It's.


01:13:47:22 - 01:13:51:00
Jimmy Rowles:
It was the first time I ever played it to.


01:13:51:02 - 01:13:54:02
Stacy Rowles:
You wrote it? I mean, you know, I can do it a little better than I did.


01:13:54:02 - 01:13:55:08
Jimmy Rowles:
I did it for the ones you like.


01:13:55:08 - 01:13:56:28
Stacy Rowles:
And then when I.


01:13:57:00 - 01:14:04:13
Leonard Feather:
Did Jimmie Rodgers Red Mitchell Trio, which really means Jimmy Rose, Red Mitchell and the drummer is Colin Bailey. He's from Australia really, isn't he? Is I.


01:14:04:13 - 01:14:05:13
Stacy Rowles:
Think so.


01:14:05:15 - 01:14:39:00
Leonard Feather:
I think that's true. That's right. And then Stacy Rose is, is a guest on on three Cards. She plays trumpet on one locomotive and it blew hard on two others. So let's play now dedicated to it and featuring Stacy Rose with Jimmy Rose, Stegall.


01:14:56:04 - 01:15:03:23
Unknown Speaker:
Oh.


01:15:03:26 - 01:15:19:10
Unknown Speaker:
I. hum, hum. Oh oh.


01:15:48:15 - 01:15:57:05
Unknown Speaker:
Oh, no.


01:15:57:07 - 01:16:04:06

Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!


01:20:46:06 - 01:20:59:13
Leonard Feather:
Oh! Another lovely tune written by one of our guests and featuring both of our guests, Jimmy Rowles. Stagger Jimmy at the piano and Stacy Ross on flugelhorn. Yeah. You should be very proud of having that dedication.


01:20:59:13 - 01:21:01:02
Stacy Rowles:
So. Yeah. Absolutely.


01:21:01:06 - 01:21:06:12
Leonard Feather:
Was that the first time you actually played it? Yeah, I showed it to you on the session.


01:21:06:14 - 01:21:19:02
Stacy Rowles:
he showed it to me before we went up, but we hadn't actually played through it. And, we went up there and we took one take and they recorded it and we said, well, we'll do one more just for posterity. So I got two chance to do it.


01:21:19:06 - 01:21:21:09
Stacy Rowles:
Yeah. That's wonderful. Jimmy.


01:21:21:09 - 01:21:33:25
Leonard Feather:
Yeah. I want to go back a little way because we we only got as far as arriving in California. Should give us a brief rundown of some of the career highlights over the years since then. Big bands, I guess. First. No small bands first. Right?


01:21:33:28 - 01:22:04:15
Jimmy Rowles:
Well, let's see, after a few little engagements here and there where they let me play, I finally got, job playing with, Al Hendrickson and a five piece band out on Slauson. And from there, one of the guys who had me playing solo and bar came out. I want to know if I wanted to play with them in San.


01:22:04:18 - 01:22:05:29
Stacy Rowles:
Oh, yeah.


01:22:06:02 - 01:22:32:06
Jimmy Rowles:
So I went to work with him at his club, has a trio. And then, we went from there out to Billy Berg's into a combination of band. It was, SummerSlam and Lee and Lester Young man. And, they had Joe Turner sang the blues and Ray Bryan dancing and spirits of rhythm. Leo Watson, Taliban.


01:22:32:06 - 01:22:33:16
Leonard Feather:
Cone in a one club.


01:22:33:16 - 01:22:35:01
Jimmy Rowles:
Oh, yeah. Everything was really.


01:22:35:01 - 01:22:36:04
Leonard Feather:
Had shows in the times.


01:22:36:06 - 01:22:39:27
Jimmy Rowles:
It was something else. It was out on peak all over and, La Cienega.


01:22:39:29 - 01:22:41:11
Leonard Feather:
Okay.


01:22:41:14 - 01:23:05:14
Jimmy Rowles:
And he lost his, liquor license there some way. We had, there was some kind of a thing happen. So he bought another club down on Beverly, block east of Fairfax on the corner. Called it the troll ville, and he changed the whole thing around. Slam it. Slam worked alone, and I worked with the Lee and Lester Young band, which was a five piece band.


01:23:05:17 - 01:23:28:17
Jimmy Rowles:
Yeah, we had two tenors and a trumpet, and Billie Holiday came out from the East and joined us. Oh, that was my introduction to her. Started playing for her, and they also kept the spares rhythm. And we had Joe Turner singing the blues, Murray Bryant spiritual rhythm, good. And Barney Bogart even came out and played with us for a while.


01:23:28:17 - 01:23:30:18
Jimmy Rowles:
We had everything going on.


01:23:30:20 - 01:23:33:01
Leonard Feather:
Lee Young, of course, was Lester's brother.


01:23:33:01 - 01:23:35:01
Jimmy Rowles:
Yes. He was the leader of the band.


01:23:35:03 - 01:23:38:21
Leonard Feather:
I guess he was. He took control because Lester wasn't exactly leader.


01:23:38:24 - 01:23:41:00
Jimmy Rowles:
No, that's. See, little leader type.


01:23:41:02 - 01:23:42:10
Stacy Rowles:
But you get along.


01:23:42:12 - 01:23:43:08
Leonard Feather:
You got along with him.


01:23:43:09 - 01:23:49:15
Jimmy Rowles:
Oh, yeah. Oh. Got along with fire. As soon as I had this guy figured out how to tie, what he meant when he started talking.


01:23:49:17 - 01:23:51:04
Leonard Feather:
Yeah, he had a very unusual way of.


01:23:51:10 - 01:23:53:09
Jimmy Rowles:
As he certainly did.


01:23:53:12 - 01:23:54:27
Leonard Feather:
Bells. You say bells first?


01:23:54:27 - 01:24:05:25
Jimmy Rowles:
Oh, he had it. He had some for everything. But he spoke English, you know. That was a face. Part of it was he be speaking and speaking English. And you still couldn't understand what he was talking about unless you had to know him?


01:24:05:28 - 01:24:09:17
Leonard Feather:
Yeah, I know I got to know him well enough to. Yeah. Through a lot of that.


01:24:09:23 - 01:24:16:24
Jimmy Rowles:
Through every day and after year after afternoon rehearsals and every day and every night. Didn't take long.


01:24:16:27 - 01:24:19:16
Leonard Feather:
Yeah. And then after that, somebody took you away from that band.


01:24:19:22 - 01:24:20:22
Jimmy Rowles:
About Benny Goodman.


01:24:20:24 - 01:24:21:18
Stacy Rowles:
Yeah.


01:24:21:21 - 01:24:23:12
Jimmy Rowles:
Which was Ben Webster's fault.


01:24:23:14 - 01:24:24:18
Leonard Feather:
Oh, really? Ben, Ben.


01:24:24:25 - 01:24:25:26
Jimmy Rowles:
Webster got me that job.


01:24:26:00 - 01:24:27:08
Leonard Feather:
He recommend you to many?


01:24:28:24 - 01:24:31:08
Leonard Feather:
You with Benny? Several times, weren't you after that?


01:24:31:08 - 01:24:48:07
Jimmy Rowles:
Yes. Several times. I didn't stay very long. First time, but I went from him to Benny. Got to, Woody Herman, then the army. After I came out of the army, I started going to different bands and I'd play with Benny and Woody several times.


01:24:48:10 - 01:24:54:22
Leonard Feather:
And then, singers. So many singers got name. Just a few of us had a Billie Holiday. I know you worked a lot for her.


01:24:54:24 - 01:25:01:29
Jimmy Rowles:
Well, see, the first singer I went out on the road with after her was Evelyn Knight. She was,


01:25:02:02 - 01:25:02:22
Stacy Rowles:
I remember.


01:25:02:24 - 01:25:04:02
Jimmy Rowles:
You know, like,


01:25:04:05 - 01:25:04:28
Leonard Feather:
Cabaret.


01:25:05:00 - 01:25:31:08
Jimmy Rowles:
Cabaret singer. And she was very nice. She's one of the best ladies, best person I ever worked for. and I went out with Vic Damone and, Bob Crosby, and I went with Peggy Lee, and. Yeah, different singers here and there, and, Carmen and Sarah Bon. Bonnie wound up with Ella Fitzgerald and.


01:25:31:12 - 01:25:36:29
Leonard Feather:
God, at least hardly anybody. That was the great singers that you have worked for. It's incredible.


01:25:37:01 - 01:25:38:06
Jimmy Rowles:
it's been quite a few.


01:25:38:09 - 01:25:39:02
Stacy Rowles:
Yeah.


01:25:39:05 - 01:25:47:13
Leonard Feather:
Well, obviously you acquired a reputation as the ideal accompanist. That's. I can think of very few people that have that kind of a feeling for singers. Well.


01:25:47:16 - 01:25:49:16
Jimmy Rowles:
That's. I don't know what to say about it.


01:25:49:23 - 01:25:53:16
Leonard Feather:
Must have been mutually pleasant. And then you became a singer yourself. That's what I wanted to come to.


01:25:53:16 - 01:26:02:02
Jimmy Rowles:
Because, Yeah. Peggy started me. Peggy Lee started me singing when I was working on. I first working with her. She's. We used to go out after hours, and she made me sing.


01:26:02:05 - 01:26:08:16
Leonard Feather:
I got a record here that you sang on. It's from an album with Joyce Morris. We got to tell the story about George's name.


01:26:08:18 - 01:26:09:10
Jimmy Rowles:
Oh, bounce.


01:26:09:15 - 01:26:10:10
Leonard Feather:
Yeah.


01:26:10:13 - 01:26:18:06
Jimmy Rowles:
Oh, well, he's from Czechoslovakia, and he, when a musician says he's bad, that means he's good, right?


01:26:18:06 - 01:26:18:24
Leonard Feather:
I know.


01:26:18:26 - 01:26:23:29
Jimmy Rowles:
And he is bad. So he's a bad chick, so I call him Bob's right.


01:26:23:29 - 01:26:30:16
Leonard Feather:
The bad bounce is wonderful. Okay, I'd like to play. This is your composition, I assume lyrics as well as music, right?


01:26:30:22 - 01:26:31:15
Stacy Rowles:
Yeah.


01:26:31:18 - 01:26:37:11
Leonard Feather:
It's called music's the only thing that's on my mind.


01:26:37:14 - 01:27:12:18
Stacy Rowles:
As a kid, I would sit and I'd listen while my mother played sweet. I don't like. And the music that she taught me, it just reached right out and caught me. And music's the only thing that's on my mind. Cause you could send me to some lonely island. All alone with my friends left behind.


01:27:12:20 - 01:27:16:08
Jimmy Rowles:
Though my thoughts might get real hazy.


01:27:16:10 - 01:27:21:18
Stacy Rowles:
I just wouldn't mind going crazy. For music's the only.


01:27:21:18 - 01:27:27:01
Unknown Speaker:
Thing that's on my mind.


01:27:27:03 - 01:28:09:23
Stacy Rowles:
It could be sad. And my heart would start aching. It could be land. Turn me on, make me glow. It always runs through my mind. While I'm sleeping. And when I wake. There's no escape. No place to go. There are times when I wish it would leave me. Disappear. Lighten up and be kind.


01:28:09:25 - 01:28:13:06
Unknown Speaker:
But the beauty that surrounds me.


01:28:13:09 - 01:29:28:21
Stacy Rowles:
Like the redwoods that grew up around me. So music's a thing for me I guess it will always be. For music's the only thing that's on my mind.


01:29:28:24 - 01:29:42:13
Stacy Rowles:
It could be sand. And my heart would start aching. For it could be glad. Turn me on and make me glow.


01:29:42:15 - 01:30:25:25
Stacy Rowles:
And always runs through my mind. While I'm sleeping. And when I wake. There's no escape. No place to go. But there are times when I wish it would leave me. Disappear. Lighten up and become my. But the beauty that surrounds me. Like the redwoods that grew up around me. For musics that sing for me I guess it will always be.


01:30:25:27 - 01:30:30:20
Stacy Rowles:
For music's the only thing.


01:30:30:22 - 01:30:40:03
Unknown Speaker:
That's on my mind.


01:30:40:05 - 01:30:47:23
Stacy Rowles:
Except.


01:30:47:26 - 01:31:02:19
Leonard Feather:
Yeah, except the golden tones of our guest vocalist. None other than Mr. Jimmy. Right? Is that the one? The. Is that the one that got you the Grammy nomination? Yes. As a singer, that's wonderful, cause you're running up against a pretty hot vocalist.


01:31:02:22 - 01:31:06:22
Jimmy Rowles:
Yes. unfortunately.


01:31:06:25 - 01:31:10:03
Leonard Feather:
However, even to be nominated as a singer must have come as a little bit of a surprise.


01:31:10:03 - 01:31:24:17
Jimmy Rowles:
Well, it certainly did. I didn't know George Simon called from New York and told me that I. You're up for two Grammys on the same record and I didn't know I started laughing, I couldn't wait.


01:31:24:19 - 01:31:25:00
Stacy Rowles:
Oh that's.


01:31:25:00 - 01:31:33:09
Leonard Feather:
Wonderful. That's a delightful song. It's not what you expect from an orthodox, you know, an opera singer not supposed to be. You know, Stacy, I know you must like it singing.


01:31:33:10 - 01:31:34:12
Stacy Rowles:
Oh, I love it.


01:31:34:15 - 01:31:36:08
Stacy Rowles:
Sir.


01:31:36:10 - 01:31:47:28
Leonard Feather:
I'd like to talk about your relationship with Wayne Short. I know you're very fond of his composition. You got three of Wayne Shorter sings in just this album alone. The album, George Mores. How did you happen to get to know him?


01:31:48:00 - 01:32:06:09
Jimmy Rowles:
I got to know him through an album I bought of, went in. Kelly. it's called Kelly. Great. and, yeah. First time I'd ever heard Wayne play. First time I'd ever heard, Lee. You know.


01:32:06:16 - 01:32:09:05
Leonard Feather:
He. Morgan. Oh, yeah. Sure.


01:32:09:07 - 01:32:20:06
Jimmy Rowles:
And, that record, I think, is probably one of the best records I've ever, ever heard. for jazz record. And I just fell in love. That's first time I ever heard when Kelly play.


01:32:21:19 - 01:32:33:14
Jimmy Rowles:
And, it just it just gave me a new outlook on everything. So I started buying. I found out that Wayne Shorter was with and and Lee Morgan were with Art Blakey.


01:32:33:21 - 01:32:34:00
Stacy Rowles:
Right.


01:32:34:07 - 01:32:41:16
Jimmy Rowles:
So I started buying every record, and I went back and bought everything. Every time I see Wayne short his name, I would buy it.


01:32:41:18 - 01:32:44:21
Leonard Feather:
Silencing at this time. You never met him?


01:32:44:23 - 01:32:55:08
Jimmy Rowles:
Never did. I never had met him. and I bought, albums that he made of his own. I finally met him at, Shelley's manhole.


01:32:55:11 - 01:32:56:03
Stacy Rowles:
Fire.


01:32:56:06 - 01:33:12:24
Jimmy Rowles:
And, took him home with me that night. And, I was with Bill Hallman. We came out to the house and stayed up all night, and I. I was playing his songs, you know, and asking him if they were right. And then, you know, I surprised him a few times.


01:33:12:26 - 01:33:16:20
Leonard Feather:
Yeah. And you probably didn't have that many fans as a composer.


01:33:16:22 - 01:33:25:06
Jimmy Rowles:
Not then, I don't know. But, I think I was sort of like his,


01:33:25:08 - 01:33:31:22
Jimmy Rowles:
certainly what you call a guy, you know, that talks about your, sponsor. yeah, I so I told everybody to listen to him.


01:33:31:23 - 01:33:33:00
Stacy Rowles:
Yeah.


01:33:33:03 - 01:33:38:09
Jimmy Rowles:
This one. Yeah. He finally recorded a song of mine. 502.


01:33:38:11 - 01:33:40:09
Leonard Feather:
That was a Blue Note album. Was that.


01:33:40:11 - 01:33:42:04
Jimmy Rowles:
Yes.


01:33:42:06 - 01:33:57:04
Leonard Feather:
I'd like to play you a record of some of his, because this is on that same album with George Mraz and, one of my favorite tracks, is this is running Brook.


01:34:00:25 - 01:34:11:06
Unknown Speaker:
From. From.


01:35:36:14 - 01:35:41:14
Unknown Speaker:
From.


01:35:41:16 - 01:36:53:29
Unknown Speaker:
Oh.


01:37:32:13 - 01:37:42:06
Unknown Speaker:
from.


01:37:50:11 - 01:37:57:03
Unknown Speaker:
Through.


01:38:01:20 - 01:38:27:04
Unknown Speaker:
From.


01:39:23:02 - 01:39:30:13
Unknown Speaker:
Oh.


01:39:30:16 - 01:39:52:05
Unknown Speaker:
Oh.


01:39:52:08 - 01:40:16:25
Leonard Feather:
Wayne shot us running. Brook, played by our guest, Jimmy Rolls. And and fabulous chick. Basis. The bad chick, George Rice. oh. The guest, of course, is Miss Stacy Rose. This is Leonard Feather with the rolls father and daughter team. And, speaking of the tuba, Stacy, that must be something. And tell us about how it's been as a female musician in the male dominated world.


01:40:16:25 - 01:40:26:14
Leonard Feather:
I talked to you about this before. I wrote about it in one of my latest pieces. But a lot about audience may not know just what it's been like. How many good breaks have you had and how many problems?


01:40:26:16 - 01:40:49:08
Stacy Rowles:
Well, I've had a lot of positive input ever since I can remember, from Friends of Dad and, my teachers were very inspiring to me. Nobody ever told me not to do it, or I was dumb to do what I was doing. Yeah, play the instrument I was playing. Or I should play something more feminine, like the violin or something.


01:40:49:10 - 01:41:05:16
Stacy Rowles:
I never got any of that kind of negativity. The only negativity I've gotten, if you want to call it negativity, is just that people who have preconceived notions about what a woman should do and what a man should do, and what a woman can do, and you know, things like that.


01:41:05:18 - 01:41:06:07
Stacy Rowles:
Yeah.


01:41:06:10 - 01:41:29:24
Stacy Rowles:
But, I think I mentioned this to you a little while ago when we were talking during a record that I really love it when I can turn somebody on to the point of just absolute astonishment or a real reaction when I play, you know, I mean, people meet me or see me or, you know, they say, oh, yeah, I've heard about you and I understand you play pretty good.


01:41:29:26 - 01:41:34:16
Stacy Rowles:
Well that's great, you know, and and they go sit down and then I play something and I look at them and they're going.


01:41:34:18 - 01:41:37:21
Stacy Rowles:
Wow, I know I, you know this.


01:41:37:24 - 01:41:40:21
Stacy Rowles:
And then it's like, wow, that was right. You know, it was a.


01:41:40:22 - 01:41:41:21
Leonard Feather:
Bit more than I expected.


01:41:41:22 - 01:41:49:07
Stacy Rowles:
So that's great. I just love turning people on like that. And that's fun. If I can do that to one person in a whole room, that makes it worth my while. Completely.


01:41:49:09 - 01:41:56:04
Leonard Feather:
yeah. Been doing that a lot the last few years. Listen, you guys, I know you had some good jobs and a lot of male band sound. You with Clark Terry at one time?


01:41:56:04 - 01:42:14:09
Stacy Rowles:
Oh, yeah, I met Clark in 1973 when I was in Monterey. And, he put together an all female big band for the Wichita Jazz Festival in 1975. and I got to play in that, and, every time he comes to town and plays someplace, I always go see him and end up sitting in with him.


01:42:14:09 - 01:42:16:20
Stacy Rowles:
And he's been a great inspiration to me.


01:42:16:20 - 01:42:18:04
Leonard Feather:
What male bands have you worked with?


01:42:18:10 - 01:42:27:29
Stacy Rowles:
Charlie Haden? Jay well, I worked with Stix Hooper. I've worked with, worked with Nelson Riddle.


01:42:28:04 - 01:42:28:17
Stacy Rowles:
Yeah, that's.


01:42:28:17 - 01:42:30:22
Stacy Rowles:
On me before, you know, a couple of New Year's gigs.


01:42:30:26 - 01:42:37:27
Leonard Feather:
And that's the kind of thing I would like to see. Got more of, you know why? Why shouldn't a Nelson Riddle, you know, people in that area call you for a job?


01:42:37:27 - 01:42:39:05
Stacy Rowles:
You know me.


01:42:39:07 - 01:42:41:16
Leonard Feather:
That's where a lot of people tend not to think of a woman.


01:42:42:11 - 01:42:47:00
Leonard Feather:
I guess, and of course, you work with a wonderful all female groups. Have. Maiden voyage is one of my favorites.


01:42:47:03 - 01:42:58:16
Stacy Rowles:
It's a real good big band. I just wish we could get a record or something out so that the people could really hear. Yeah, how the band can does sound. It's just keeps getting better and better all the time.


01:42:58:17 - 01:43:01:03
Leonard Feather:
Are you still playing occasionally with alive?


01:43:01:05 - 01:43:21:15
Stacy Rowles:
yeah, once in a while. They're kind of on a hiatus right now, and I'm kind of going in a different direction myself, so, I don't know how much longer I'll play with them, but I've been with them now for about two years, playing pretty much all of their gigs. Yeah, with them, but they they have a tendency to use different horn players and have different featured artists and things.


01:43:21:15 - 01:43:26:21
Stacy Rowles:
And, you know, I think it's real good to just keep moving around and play with as many people as you can.


01:43:26:23 - 01:43:41:17
Leonard Feather:
I like to play a cut from the album that you know, that I produced with you and your father, Stacy Rosen, Jimmy Rose. The album is called Tell It Like It Is, and that is another Wayne Shorter composition in that. In fact, there are two Wayne's in there, and, I'm going to try to play maybe two out of this, if we have time.


01:43:41:19 - 01:43:50:22
Leonard Feather:
And, coincidentally, Jimmy suggested doing this next tune, which happens to be the theme of my radio show as you well know. Would you first hear this on Duke's old record, Muddy Like the Blues?


01:43:50:24 - 01:43:54:21
Jimmy Rowles:
Well, I had that record. I found that record in Lewiston, Idaho.


01:43:54:23 - 01:43:55:26
Leonard Feather:
No kidding.


01:43:55:28 - 01:43:59:17
Jimmy Rowles:
And I got it for a dime. But that was long time ago.


01:43:59:18 - 01:44:33:28
Leonard Feather:
Yeah, that's the old original version. Yeah, well, we'd like to show you what what Jimmy and Stacy did with us. It's mighty like the blues with Jimmy and Stacy and Herman Riley on tenor sax and Chuck Berghoff on bass, Donald Bailey on drums. Recorded here in Hollywood. One was 84. Was a couple years ago. Here we go.


01:44:34:00 - 01:44:50:17

01:48:02:07 - 01:48:22:20
Leonard Feather:
Yeah. That's, Regular. Same played. Not this time by Duke Ellington with my by our guests Stacy Rolls and Jimmy Rolls. Mighty like the blues from the album. Tell it like It is. Jimmy. You've had a long ongoing relationship with the Ellington mystique, playing a lot of Ellington music and Billy Strayhorn music. I assume that you knew them both pretty well.


01:48:22:23 - 01:48:24:03
Jimmy Rowles:
Fairly well.


01:48:24:05 - 01:48:25:04
Leonard Feather:
Particularly Strayhorn.


01:48:25:04 - 01:48:30:29
Jimmy Rowles:
I, I think I knew them both about the same. I knew Strayhorn pretty good.


01:48:31:01 - 01:48:40:23
Leonard Feather:
Yeah. And did a lot of his compositions. You have a lovely album out to me, all his plays, Ellington and Strayhorn, which I hope is still available.


01:48:40:26 - 01:48:47:22
Jimmy Rowles:
I think they're going to, reissue it. Henry, Renoir told me they're going to reissue it.


01:48:47:24 - 01:49:05:00
Leonard Feather:
There's one record that, of course, is on the same album we just played a cut from. That is one of my favorite. I know one of your favorite Strayhorn tunes. Maybe it's to analyze, but I think Billy wrote it, not you, basically. Yeah, Stacey, you know what I'm talking about. yeah, I think we just have time to put this on.


01:49:05:00 - 01:49:06:01
Leonard Feather:
Just loved to play it. It's.


01:49:06:04 - 01:49:07:12
Stacy Rowles:
It's my favorite.


01:49:07:14 - 01:49:09:02
Leonard Feather:
Out of the album. It's my favorite.


01:49:09:02 - 01:49:11:22
Stacy Rowles:
This is a toss up between this one and, old folks.


01:49:11:22 - 01:50:54:06
Leonard Feather:
Yeah. Yeah, that's great too. But this is just the two of them. But my two guests. No rhythm section, just a duo performance by Stacey Rose and Jimmy Rose. Billy Stones Lotus Blossom.

01:52:57:13 - 01:53:14:29
Leonard Feather:
Oh, what a gorgeous performance. What a beautiful tune. That's a great combination. Stacey rose and flow behind Jimmy Rose at the piano. Yeah, just the two of them. Thank you blossom. That was quite an experience. I think making that album was one of the nicest things I've done in so many years.


01:53:15:02 - 01:53:16:03
Jimmy Rowles:
Those of you.


01:53:16:06 - 01:53:30:18
Leonard Feather:
In the studio, thank you so much, Stacey and Jimmy. Well, I'll tell you what I'd like to do if you can stick around. I brought along some other records that you don't know. I want to do something that I used to do on another station here years ago in Los Angeles. That is, do a live blindfold test on the air.


01:53:30:20 - 01:53:38:20
Leonard Feather:
the guessing part is not important. The important part? Just to get your opinion, hear reaction to a few records by other people. Are you game.


01:53:38:22 - 01:53:39:13
Stacy Rowles:
Should I.


01:53:39:15 - 01:53:50:05
Leonard Feather:
Not? That will be wonderful. And then we'll play that next week okay. But now I'm playing next week. So yeah, it's a great idea. I would enjoy doing that. Okay. So thank you again I'll be thank you again another time in a few.


01:53:50:05 - 01:53:51:14
Stacy Rowles:
Minutes Stacey.


01:53:51:14 - 01:53:52:23

Stacy Rowles:
You Leonard.

Until next time. Same time. This is Leonard Feather saying so long for now. And thanks as always for being with us.
