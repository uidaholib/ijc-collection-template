So unhappy. But now I'm through. But definitely going to cut back on vigor. So. Gate, Avenue. I've got to be a road terror. So I didn't win. in the group.


00:03:15:12 - 00:03:16:21
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Down.


00:03:16:24 - 00:03:38:07
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
It sounds like that's the name. commercially, I. What's wonderful. I think, the cut in it was recorded. Well, bass player very good. Has a very nice song. Full sound, a little more or less. Yeah. Musically, I'd say it was a good record if it's fat, so I wouldn't be surprised. It sounds a lot like it.


00:03:38:09 - 00:03:40:29
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Do I have Toward the Stars?


00:03:41:02 - 00:03:51:10
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
yeah. But, let me tell about that. regardless of that, come out. What you think of that far down the what is considered here?


00:03:51:12 - 00:03:53:13
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Well, I think this is that type of piano.


00:03:53:13 - 00:03:57:05
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
How's it going to it has or ever will go out, you know.


00:03:57:07 - 00:03:59:12
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
It's something that you can anyone can listen to.


00:03:59:14 - 00:04:00:02
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Yeah.


00:04:00:04 - 00:04:03:06
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
It's more or less I call them more, more or less of an amiable style.


00:04:03:08 - 00:04:08:22
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
So it could work with.


00:04:08:25 - 00:04:10:10
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
yeah. What would you give it? You know what? They're ready.


00:04:10:10 - 00:04:13:22
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
I made four, three, two and one. Yeah, I'll give it three.


00:04:13:25 - 00:04:17:17
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Okay.


00:04:17:20 - 00:04:24:24
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Yeah. All right. Unaffordable. Thank you so very much.


00:04:24:26 - 00:04:48:06
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Going to musically to fine record length commercially. I don't think it holds much value because I don't the public is, up to that standard in music. Yeah. As yet, I believe it's Tristano in college, isn't it? It sounds just like him. And, of course Lee Konitz is one of my favorites. And Lenny, I think everything was accurate, executed more than well in the record.


00:04:48:06 - 00:04:54:13
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
I get it. Definitely three stars.


00:04:54:16 - 00:05:15:18
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Ever sounded like. No. But, well, I think it's been more less of a very droll tune where the group didn't sound too well coordinated. However, for the, for the opening of it and the part of the piano. Of course, I'd give it two stars. I don't think it holds that much musical value.


00:05:15:21 - 00:05:20:13
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Yeah.


00:05:20:15 - 00:05:24:07
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Wow.


00:05:24:10 - 00:05:26:13
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
That's horrible.


00:05:26:15 - 00:05:42:07
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Whoever it is, I don't know. There's nothing there. So I have to say, no stars, no bells, nothing.


00:05:42:09 - 00:05:49:07
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Well, I call that a good example of, how Art Tatum has ruined so many piano players unconsciously.


00:05:49:10 - 00:05:50:16
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
You know, I, I.


00:05:50:16 - 00:06:08:28
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Didn't like that record at all. And and the first course was too spasmodic. I think he was trying to, whoever it was, was trying to imitate Tatum to too much of a degree. The second chorus shows it was definitely that way, because more or less he settled down, or in his own, his own style, and without the Tatum ideas, he was lost.


00:06:09:00 - 00:06:14:11
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
I give it one and a half start. Think.


00:06:14:13 - 00:06:16:04
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Oh, this harpsichord doesn't.


00:06:16:07 - 00:06:17:12
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Have to go back.


00:06:17:15 - 00:06:37:07
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Well, I like I like the record person. I don't know who it could be. whoever it is has a wonderful technique. for the tune, I think is more or less worn out. It's been done so many times, but, on the whole, I like the record. I give it two and a half stars. Leonard heard. Technically, I think it's a good record.


00:06:37:07 - 00:06:52:03
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
I don't think that, whoever it is was playing. Yes. When actually had a chance to, express all of his ideas on the disc. I think through the two off the record, you can find smatterings of of, talent. A lot of talent.


00:06:52:03 - 00:07:01:21
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Yeah. Oh, yeah.


00:07:01:23 - 00:07:20:16
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Commercial. I think it's a good record. One thing that, I always do by my own personal records, even if there's a record with just four bars that I like, I buy it, you know, and I think that first chorus was actually too delicate for the tenor solo that followed. The vocal and the vocal.


00:07:20:17 - 00:07:21:04
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
The piano or.


00:07:21:07 - 00:07:29:29
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
The piano, of course. Yes. But, on the whole, I like the record tenor solo fitted the type of vocal that was done. I'd give it three stars.


00:07:30:01 - 00:07:30:14
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
And there.


00:07:30:14 - 00:07:38:18
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Were no idea.


00:07:38:20 - 00:08:03:27
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
I'm unfamiliar with, Dixieland because it's the type of music I don't necessarily dislike, but I don't. It doesn't intrigue me that much. And, not being a judge or classifying myself as a judge of, Dixieland kind of guy, just give it two and a half stars for it. and I'm in insofar as listening value. And from what I've heard of Dixieland, I'd say would be good Dixieland.


00:08:04:00 - 00:08:14:18
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
you know, Ellington, regardless of what type of music there is, you know, whatever music you listen to, there is such a thing as good and bad. And I would classify it as Good Dixieland, although I don't particularly go for the contemporary.


00:08:14:23 - 00:08:15:21
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
particular song.


00:08:15:28 - 00:08:16:09
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
I like the.


00:08:16:09 - 00:08:22:25
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Trumpet solo very much. I'd give it, two and a half stars just on the trumpets.


00:08:22:27 - 00:08:30:11
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
and comment on the piano. You know, work. okay.


00:08:30:14 - 00:08:47:27
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
But before we go any further, you can give this one for stars, because, And if you don't mind, I'll just. I'll remarks. I have to, to make about this recording, but the piano solo, even though I know the Benny Goodman group, the record on the whole is fine, but the piano solo, I think, is more than outstanding.


00:08:47:27 - 00:09:08:23
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
In fact, I've never heard Teddy turn out, bad record as yet. It is. Terry Wilson has been, if I remember correctly. the, the, I don't want to say the clean technique, the taste, the touch. There isn't anything you can say wrong on the piano because, yeah, of course, because Teddy is more or less, to me, a genius.


00:09:08:26 - 00:09:32:20
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
And, along with the piano solo, the the, planet solo by many movement, I think it's one of his more subtle things. I've heard him swing a little more, but on the whole, I think, the group was wonderful and bad vibes. It's written over. I believe. I don't think he played very well there. But however the, the, other solos went on the record more or less made up for whatever happened there.


00:09:32:22 - 00:09:37:19
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Okay.


00:09:37:22 - 00:09:40:29
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
And.


00:09:41:01 - 00:09:48:27
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Well.


00:09:49:00 - 00:10:14:28
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Well, it sounds like. Do the piano solo. From what I heard, didn't exactly resemble the style. I would say it possibly could be Billy Strayhorn, but, on the whole, in in parts, it doesn't sound like the only band, but there's enough there. For instance, I think it's Lawrence Brown on trombone. The record on the whole impressed me this way that, it's a very weak Ellington thing.


00:10:15:01 - 00:10:19:26
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
I mean, I've heard better, in my opinion. I've heard better things by Duke.


00:10:19:28 - 00:10:21:28
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
is a better concert better?


00:10:22:00 - 00:10:43:11
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Yes, I have that's that's definitely I would say this is one of his weaker habits. On the whole, I think it lacks the usual Ellington continuity. You know, the parts that just don't sound like I went to, If it is Duke, and, the troubled solo is outstanding. I like the piano solo. I would say, Billy, stay on the piano.


00:10:43:13 - 00:10:57:18
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Doesn't sound like this. I'd give it, three stars.


00:10:57:20 - 00:10:59:13
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
you like that kind of music?


00:10:59:15 - 00:11:23:08
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
do. President. I mean, it's kind of over my head, you know? Oh, we are in it or under it? Oh, it went from my head. But it's nice, and I can. But I can get it. That rhythm that goes back, that of. Yeah, that's the only thing other than that I could make it, you know, if it was straight with.


00:11:23:10 - 00:11:24:17
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Yeah. Something like that.


00:11:24:21 - 00:11:27:06
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
But then again, I'm not that.


00:11:27:08 - 00:11:27:28
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Yeah.


00:11:28:00 - 00:11:29:07
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
I only work that.


00:11:29:09 - 00:11:46:11
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
I said it on the weekends. I mean just because then a number you know, the way I would fare. Yeah, yeah.


00:11:46:13 - 00:11:48:08
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
What do you think of that band?


00:11:48:10 - 00:12:03:13
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
I thought all of it was nice. Just other than the rhythm that you. They could have been much better there, you know? Yeah. Hadn't they had that kind of rhythm, this straight line, you know, get it like that. Yeah.


00:12:03:15 - 00:12:07:12
Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker:
Right.


00:12:07:14 - 00:12:15:21
Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker:
And I don't remember,


00:12:15:23 - 00:12:38:02
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Yeah. It's real crazy. I like it was I think I heard it once in Chicago. yeah. You know, I'm not, the only thing I would say would be Woody Herman and either Stan Getz, you know, that's that's not that's bad. You know, I know, and I know the name of the tenor player, but it it's it's crazy the way the arrangements and things.


00:12:38:04 - 00:12:49:22
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
yeah, I think that's real great. yeah, I like it. I go like that. In fact, I'm gonna get the address for music and get the record, you know? Okay. Sure.


00:12:49:23 - 00:12:57:23
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Yeah, yeah. But with that, are you be surprised again with. A different sound.


00:12:57:25 - 00:13:15:24
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Yeah. Well, I mean, I'll go for that too, you know, I like it because we played in Chicago with, my fan. Yeah. And they was waving with the Dixieland. I mean, you know, so people like things like that is real nice. So I think it's crazy.


00:13:15:24 - 00:13:17:17
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Do you think it's done well in.


00:13:17:24 - 00:13:18:09
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Show.


00:13:18:12 - 00:13:20:03
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
You like that? That,


00:13:20:05 - 00:13:29:11
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Who is that? But, Raymond, I mean, if it's, Yeah, whoever it is. Yeah. I thought it was nice when they dropped it. Solo thing. Yeah, that was very nice.


00:13:29:13 - 00:13:35:07
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
You did, did you hear that that that was kind of playing a long time ago like that.


00:13:35:09 - 00:13:51:16
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Yeah. That's right now. Yeah. And all the time it used to be but criminalized play with Tommy Dorsey. Yeah. That, something like that. And I used to him when I used to play those records and things like that. Yeah. Nobody never played like that. And so I like a stylus. Yeah. You know, so it was a style of design.


00:13:51:18 - 00:13:58:08
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Yeah. Like that. It was nice. I think you could say nothing, but it's nice, you know.


00:13:58:11 - 00:14:00:20
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Or you.


00:14:00:22 - 00:14:06:09
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
I think, on the kind of a Dixieland I think.


00:14:06:11 - 00:14:10:17
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Three, three. That's nice. Right? Okay. Yeah.


00:14:10:20 - 00:14:14:05
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Yeah. It.


00:14:14:07 - 00:14:20:20
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Yeah.


00:14:20:23 - 00:14:31:10
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
All the way. I think that's real nice. The Klan and I don't know, the band and nothing like that, but, I mean, it's beautiful music, you know? And, like, that tune.


00:14:31:13 - 00:14:32:21
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Worked really hard.


00:14:32:23 - 00:14:36:24
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Yeah, well, I don't know what it is, but I think it's so pretty. Okay.


00:14:37:02 - 00:14:39:15
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Yeah. I like particular favorite.


00:14:39:18 - 00:15:03:03
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
No, I never dig into the into the classical. Yeah. Yeah. You know, I wouldn't know what to say. Very few records I've heard, because I never done that deep, you know. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I do give them full liberty. I don't know, the band. And then. So it's better I'm gonna try to get the record to.


00:15:03:05 - 00:15:07:23
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Yeah. And they're.


00:15:07:25 - 00:15:16:09
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
These two inches are so loaded with that. All the time. I don't really know how they do it.


00:15:16:11 - 00:15:17:02
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Right.


00:15:17:05 - 00:15:20:28
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Yeah. The only one who discussed was the trumpet. I think, you know, whenever.


00:15:21:00 - 00:15:33:04
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
The trumpet was playing on, then, well, I don't think I would go like, just one and I'd say Al Killian. no, other than that, I'll put it at.


00:15:33:09 - 00:15:39:03
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Okay. you know, what do you do you think? Oh, I've done a record.


00:15:39:06 - 00:15:41:21
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Oh. Well, I have to, That's my people. You know.


00:15:41:21 - 00:15:42:20
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
About the.


00:15:42:23 - 00:15:50:14
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Santa Fe? Yeah. Nothing but great. They got it.


00:15:50:16 - 00:15:52:18
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Do you like the,


00:15:52:20 - 00:16:07:01
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
I know what I want to ask you. what do you think about the general new school of kind of man? All these, young kids like the brother, you know, like the whole new school kind of, that are inspired by you.


00:16:07:04 - 00:16:19:16
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
everybody want to ask me that? When I tell you what, they just fascinate me, you know? Yeah. Because I hear little things that have played, you know? Yeah. And I did that. Yeah, things like that.


00:16:19:19 - 00:16:22:12
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
If you like the way things are going down here.


00:16:22:14 - 00:16:48:16
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
I mean, I always like that. Like that, you know what I mean? Because whenever I came to New York, you know, I got blues because I didn't play like Coleman Hawkins. So I used to do a lot of teardrops and that. But, I mean, I say, well, you know, some people have asked for certain things here. So. Yes, Lester, the way you feel and I hear people playing like that, I go and buy their records too and things and sit up and listen and knock me out, you know what?


00:16:48:16 - 00:16:51:02
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Right do you buy for your record?


00:16:51:05 - 00:17:06:13
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
Yeah. Or just the ones I like the same way, like you playing up, I get one, I like it or something. Or they play one over the radio or something. I'll go and get it. something like that. I like to be, like, more to like a variety, you know, I would like to get hung up with one thing, you know?


00:17:06:15 - 00:17:08:16
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
So that's why I speak like that.


00:17:08:23 - 00:17:12:15
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
You know, I play quite a wide variety of things. And you like, oh, my God.


00:17:12:18 - 00:17:22:19
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
That's very, guitar music and all day and all night music and thing, you know, it's just right there.


00:17:22:21 - 00:17:35:27
Duke Ellington or Duke Ellington or Unknown Speaker: Speaker:
You have any any particular all time favorite record that we're with them. Record? Yeah. I mean, like, that thing that you ever wanted to get well started, you know, including your on it. You're right.


00:17:36:00 - 00:17:52:18
