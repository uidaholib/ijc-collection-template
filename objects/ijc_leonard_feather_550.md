Unknown Speaker:
Yeah. Wasn't wasn't too much happen. Didn't, didn't go anywhere. In fact, it didn't didn't it didn't feel very comfortable.


00:01:12:01 - 00:01:14:12
Unknown Speaker:
In the rhythm section I just so it was the both.


00:01:14:14 - 00:01:18:00

Yeah. We're both. Yeah.


00:01:18:03 - 00:01:33:18
Unknown Speaker:
Yeah. The rhythm didn't didn't nothing happened a couple of times it kind of got turned around and the big turned around a little bit, but, it didn't sound very comfortable. And I didn't.


00:01:33:20 - 00:01:39:01
Unknown Speaker:
It doesn't sound like that was the best take. Must have been a better take on that one on the day.


00:01:43:09 - 00:01:46:05
Unknown Speaker:
So, Yeah.


00:01:46:05 - 00:01:50:19

Well, two and a half stars and.


00:01:50:22 - 00:01:57:27

And do you have any particular comments about any of those, those two in general?


00:01:57:29 - 00:02:05:06
Unknown Speaker:
Oh, well, I yeah, I dig them all. I dig I dig Ringo's,


00:02:05:08 - 00:02:07:08
Unknown Speaker:
Well, I think it's beautiful on.


00:02:07:09 - 00:02:36:04
Unknown Speaker:
On trombone and who incidentally, has a very, very, a big fan, in Copenhagen, young trombone player that Copenhagen was his name, tore off. I really tore off his, he's a Benny Green, man. He was. Every time I see him, he wants to know who has been a green. Was Benny Green doing,


00:02:36:06 - 00:03:05:00
Unknown Speaker:
He loves a and of course, I love Joe. And who, well, I've known all my life, more or less. and, I'm quite, Who was was always a dead giveaway. there's nobody sounds like that. Yeah, the other ten of. I wasn't sure about that. I don't know who the sound of some of the sound of my youth.


00:03:05:03 - 00:03:13:09
Unknown Speaker:
I wasn't sure everyone okay?


00:03:13:11 - 00:03:29:10
Unknown Speaker:
And was a shame to waste a beautiful arrangement like that. yeah. I was honking. Yeah. But,


00:03:29:13 - 00:03:34:06
Unknown Speaker:
You know, I only knew there were.


00:03:34:06 - 00:03:45:07
Unknown Speaker:
Only traces of of of the heart that I love. he sounded like,


00:03:45:10 - 00:03:47:23
Unknown Speaker:
like he was a little under the weather on that one.


00:03:47:25 - 00:03:49:00
Unknown Speaker:
Yeah, sure.


00:03:49:02 - 00:04:00:19
Unknown Speaker:
Yeah. It was a beautiful arrangement. I don't know who. I don't know who wrote the arrangement. It was beautiful. I it nice.


00:04:00:21 - 00:04:07:23
Unknown Speaker:
But, and I wasn't there, and it was.


00:04:07:26 - 00:04:21:18
Unknown Speaker:
it was a Johnny Walker playing, it's, you know, when I need to work, on tenor. but,


00:04:21:20 - 00:04:25:24
Unknown Speaker:
Mainly like he has the sound of his phrasing about.


00:04:25:26 - 00:04:56:07
Unknown Speaker:
Well, yeah, yeah, yeah, he was so just it couldn't, it couldn't put anything together. and, and he obviously wasn't that familiar with it in front that, that he could play it anyway, you know. Yeah. If he had, if he had known it and been just, well, might not have made too much difference, you know, but not knowing it and being just to then it was just fumbling and feeling and trying to find it and.


00:04:56:10 - 00:05:02:03
Unknown Speaker:
Yeah. Yeah. And of course, he, you never did, you know, you couldn't put anything together.


00:05:02:05 - 00:05:05:05
Unknown Speaker:
And it's nice. I love the arrangement.


00:05:05:05 - 00:05:17:09
Unknown Speaker:
Yeah. Once off with arrangement. Yeah. I think it.


00:05:17:11 - 00:05:21:17
Unknown Speaker:
Yeah. The rabbit.


00:05:21:19 - 00:05:29:23
Unknown Speaker:
was quite a contrast with the other record.


00:05:29:25 - 00:05:30:22
Unknown Speaker:
Because this one, everything.


00:05:30:22 - 00:05:37:03
Unknown Speaker:
Was, nice and easy.


00:05:37:05 - 00:05:47:16
Unknown Speaker:
Melodic. It was beautiful. Yeah. Johnny Hodges, Johnny Hodges.


00:05:47:18 - 00:05:52:19
Unknown Speaker:
Yeah. He's fantastic.


00:05:52:21 - 00:05:57:02
Unknown Speaker:
I don't know who the,


00:05:57:04 - 00:06:14:15
Unknown Speaker:
The guitar player one was Burrell. Maybe. Yeah. Kind of, growing up. Yeah. The organ play. I don't kill me too much. It was competent, but,


00:06:14:18 - 00:06:19:06
Unknown Speaker:
You don't to the organ criticizing.


00:06:19:09 - 00:06:40:07
Unknown Speaker:
to. no, not to all because I have You know, I, I worked with some in Chicago and, it's, it's, it's, you know, it's it's a different groove. Yeah. And and it's possible to, to get a nice groove going.


00:06:40:07 - 00:06:44:13
Unknown Speaker:
With an organ. Yeah.


00:06:44:15 - 00:07:04:10
Unknown Speaker:
I wouldn't necessarily choose an organ for my group or something, but, Yeah, you know, I can. The public digs a obviously, because the Vikings, they're very popular. And, Yeah, that's a range of cover. And, some of the places.


00:07:04:10 - 00:07:09:24
Unknown Speaker:
In the, uptown. Right? Yeah.


00:07:09:27 - 00:07:15:01
Unknown Speaker:
I guess because it, it fills up the room and, it sounds like a big band.


00:07:15:03 - 00:07:18:12
Unknown Speaker:
and,


00:07:18:15 - 00:07:22:09
Unknown Speaker:
that's because got a lot of different with the organ, too. On a and a piano, too.


00:07:22:12 - 00:07:27:08
Unknown Speaker:
Yeah, but how would you rate this?


00:07:27:10 - 00:07:49:02
Unknown Speaker:
yeah, I would rate it. yeah. Three stars. Yeah, yeah, it was nice.


00:07:49:05 - 00:08:04:15
Unknown Speaker:
Yeah. Done. And that's a shame that, Don's been away so long. Like, cats over here have, forgotten about it. Not hip to him anymore.


00:08:04:16 - 00:08:05:29
Unknown Speaker:
Yeah, I know, you know.


00:08:06:02 - 00:08:21:18
Unknown Speaker:
And he's he's pulling his ass off because, he came to Copenhagen, 3 or 4 times when I was, and, we used to play together.


00:08:24:26 - 00:08:59:14
Unknown Speaker:
And he's, he's he's in good shape physically, and and he's, like I said, his brain is very sensitive and, although, I don't know, I don't know how much he he doesn't, I don't think he works as much as he should. but, you. Because he's, just taking things easy. he's living in Holland and, and he's, we've got a spot where he,


00:08:59:17 - 00:09:20:16
Unknown Speaker:
It's good deals all the time. he's in good shape, and he's strong as a band. and, Yeah, several nights, man, we were we moved on together until about 6 or 7:00 in the morning, and my manager. was this live at my manager?


00:09:20:18 - 00:09:21:17
Unknown Speaker:
It's like. So.


00:09:21:20 - 00:09:40:26
Unknown Speaker:
Yeah. So. Yeah. Yeah, that. But on the, Yeah, it sounded like. But yeah, there was, but on it and probably, probably it was, the kid playing bass, Niels Henning, who was fantastic. Have you heard him yet?


00:09:40:29 - 00:09:41:25
Unknown Speaker:
And another version.


00:09:41:25 - 00:09:48:10
Unknown Speaker:
But yeah. Yeah, he's fantastic. And,


00:09:48:13 - 00:09:51:27
Unknown Speaker:
Jim, I don't know who that was.


00:09:51:29 - 00:10:18:25
Unknown Speaker:
It was probably the, William Schiff. I Alex will probably it was Schiff of the, of that number. Yeah, yeah. I couldn't yeah. I couldn't tell who it is. It was probably so and and it it sounded like, if it was, one might sound like so many people in that album sound like a concert hall or in a hall, or rather, that.


00:10:18:28 - 00:10:24:04
Unknown Speaker:
Yeah. well, anyway, you liked it.

00:11:09:00 - 00:11:09:03
Unknown Speaker:
A.


00:11:09:10 - 00:11:15:26

surprising. What a what a fact. You can good without using using that instrumentation and without the brass, Right. Because I imagine there's a lot of skill to, I'm sure. Right? Yeah. Right. Because everybody, Yeah, that was very interesting that the template, how it was,


00:12:28:19 - 00:12:30:04
Unknown Speaker:
let's read it for us.


00:12:30:06 - 00:12:40:04
Unknown Speaker:
Yeah. Well, yeah, I would, I would, I would write it,


00:12:40:07 - 00:12:43:09

00:12:43:11 - 00:12:45:05
Unknown Speaker:
Well.


00:12:45:08 - 00:12:52:27

Unknown Speaker:
Yeah. I.


00:13:29:20 - 00:13:36:07

Like the writing to them.


00:13:53:25 - 00:14:19:14
Unknown Speaker:
Yeah. That was beautiful. What there was of it? Yeah, but it was, Well, it was just a little bit. It was so very, very effective, you know, it meant something, every, you know, everything. And everything meant something and talked about very much. and the bass player was beautiful. I don't know, it sounded like I said it sounded like Wilbur.


00:14:19:14 - 00:14:25:27
Unknown Speaker:
Well, but I'm not sure who is, but I would, I would give it, I would give it four stars.

Unknown Speaker:
Yeah. It,


00:14:41:19 - 00:14:54:02
Unknown Speaker:
Yeah. The tune writing. I had a I had a monk flavor. But, I we definitely wasn't one.


00:14:54:04 - 00:15:09:22
Unknown Speaker:
Because I think they would have given him a piano solo in the. It was the vibes. the vibe players. It wasn't bags. I don't know who that was.


00:15:09:25 - 00:15:32:18
Unknown Speaker:

Unknown Speaker:
Right? Yeah.


00:15:35:01 - 00:16:03:11
Unknown Speaker:
Yeah, that was very good. I liked it. I like the free thing they're doing in the bridge of the nose. is, kind of dumb, and, I'm Joe Henderson. Yeah. I don't know who the rhythm section is. That's how good friend have, they all sound good. Yeah. And, you know, joints. And it sounds good.


00:16:03:14 - 00:16:05:09
Unknown Speaker:
New saxophonist on the scene?


00:16:05:13 - 00:16:05:24
Unknown Speaker:
Yeah.


00:16:06:00 - 00:16:30:01
Unknown Speaker:
Yeah, it sounds good. I like his, it's nice and fluid. And then he gets a nice, full, nice, full, full sound on the bottom of his. You know, it's all under control. And, digging. Okay. This sounds very good. and, you know, I got a chance to play with him, in Copenhagen to.


00:16:30:01 - 00:16:37:16
Unknown Speaker:
We had, we had a couple of, radio things, radio shows and.


00:16:37:18 - 00:16:38:05

Unknown Speaker:
Yeah. John, it was it was fantastic. It was in the summer. It was hot. And, and the joint was just just packed. You couldn't move in it, you know? And, So, and after the, after the, after the first set, Don took off his, shirt and and an undershirt. He was just playing in his in his and in his in his pants.


00:17:56:15 - 00:18:03:09

And I'm playing nude tenor. It's fantastic. Yeah.


00:18:03:09 - 00:18:07:21
Unknown Speaker:
We had a ball and it was just between us, but.


00:18:07:23 - 00:18:13:26
Unknown Speaker:
Yeah. I think, I think the band had wound up, finished the tour.


00:18:13:27 - 00:18:21:02
Unknown Speaker:
And, He stayed over. He stayed overnight and.


00:18:21:03 - 00:18:35:06
Unknown Speaker:
Just happened so that Don was, on his way to Stockholm or something, and he was in town, so he just he just hired them all to come and work with me, you know? So we had a ball and,


00:18:35:08 - 00:18:36:16
Unknown Speaker:
a fantastic audience.


00:18:36:16 - 00:18:42:18
Unknown Speaker:
Over that beautiful audience as well.


00:18:44:02 - 00:18:51:13
Unknown Speaker:
Yeah. It was, Well.


00:18:51:16 - 00:18:58:08
Unknown Speaker:
It was a little hard to, It was it was great, but, What?


00:18:58:11 - 00:19:03:12
Unknown Speaker:
Well, I know what you mean. Follow me. Like this. The.


00:19:03:15 - 00:19:16:03
Unknown Speaker:
Yeah. What I didn't do. And then I kind of sound like it was kind of, in between, unfinished.


00:19:16:05 - 00:19:20:27
Unknown Speaker:
I didn't get a real definite.


00:19:20:29 - 00:19:25:20
Unknown Speaker:
Feeling it sound like it was leading into something. yeah.


00:19:25:23 - 00:19:28:23
Unknown Speaker:
That's probably the arrangement it was supposed to bring on the next day.


00:19:28:25 - 00:19:35:04
Unknown Speaker:
Yeah, yeah. So. But it was beautiful, and, so 3000.


00:19:35:08 - 00:19:37:28
Unknown Speaker:
Yeah.


00:19:38:00 - 00:20:00:28
Speaker 5
Like mood music to me. That jazz and the composition, whatever it was, was it. The composition was. Well, what? I didn't like the composition because it, it never had a, had a middle or or in and it just seemed to keep on going and in anything. Then you have to have, have, have one. Yeah.


00:20:01:00 - 00:20:04:16
Unknown Speaker:
Who was it that was you through not writing.


00:20:04:16 - 00:20:15:21
Speaker 5
No no no. Written. I can't read it as a. Okay.


00:20:15:23 - 00:20:18:15
Unknown Speaker:
Well.


00:20:18:17 - 00:20:48:07
Speaker 5
Some people would say the piano player had good harmonics but I don't think so. When you would play something and take it almost entirely out of context of the way any composition was, was written. And the bass player had wonderful intonation. And I like the harmonics that the bass player was using. Yeah, but the piano player had good technique and everything, but.


00:20:48:10 - 00:21:04:14
Speaker 5
He just, you know, it's certain things such as building and whatever you were doing, whatever you didn't anything to bill to me at the wrong time in the context of what he was playing. So I don't know what to say about it, you know.


00:21:04:16 - 00:21:06:12
Unknown Speaker:
And it's not like anybody particular.


00:21:06:15 - 00:21:31:26
Speaker 5
Well, Lawrence Bass, I would have given it fair because it sounded like a slight with two me. I went, that was one of the best piano players around. And a reader named Billy Wallace. See, but but even using Billy Wallace as a standard that I would, would say was a poor performance, because anytime you take a tune out context that is written within it, you know, you know, you you shouldn't do.


00:21:31:27 - 00:21:46:05
Speaker 5
That's just writing something to be different. Well, why would the harmonics he he seemed to have that his ability at his fingertips each could be to write some nice music itself. Yeah. Instead of changing beautiful tunes around.


00:21:46:07 - 00:21:46:22
Unknown Speaker:
Okay.


00:21:46:29 - 00:21:58:12
Speaker 5
Whoever.


00:21:58:15 - 00:22:27:18

Let's sound like one of my favorites, Thelonius Monk, which, I would give the record five stars for his presence. Plus one of my favorite bass players who were. In the compositions with a composition, actually, I could I could hear another horn player on the melody, melodies and stuff. But that for for a monk presence and Wilbur. Whereas whereas presence.


00:22:27:24 - 00:22:34:22

Speaker 5
no comment about anyone else.


00:22:46:20 - 00:23:10:15
Speaker 5

Time, time is so, so predominant that they really can flow by themselves like they would when they play with a horn player.


00:23:10:18 - 00:23:22:16
Speaker 5
But it was a good performance even though it was an Art, Tatum said earlier. Yeah, even though a piano player actually don't have to be, you just have to have an understanding of a tenor thing.
