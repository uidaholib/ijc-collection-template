# Oscar Peterson Blindfold Test -- Lester Young Blindfold Test [transcript]

00:00:00:00 - 00:00:42:08
Leonard Feather or Oscar Peterson:
Turn it down. It sounds like sense to me. commercially. And what's wonderful, I think. the covenant was recorded. Well, this goes down very as a very nice, full sound in more or less. Yeah. Musically, I think it was a good record. If it's better, I wouldn't be surprised if it sounds a lot like, Do I have to award this tax, this specific, but, let me tell you about what you think that the of the presidential vote comes up, about what you think of that again, about what it to.


00:00:42:11 - 00:00:59:18
Leonard Feather or Oscar Peterson:
Well, I think this is that type of piano as it is, it has or ever will go out. You know, it's something that you can anyone can listen to. Yeah. It's more or less I call them more, more or less of an amiable style, I think, is what the.


00:00:59:27 - 00:01:10:16
Leonard Feather or Oscar Peterson:
yeah. What would you give it? You know what I mean? Port two and one. You know, I'd give it the thing. Okay.


00:01:12:15 - 00:01:15:26
Leonard Feather or Oscar Peterson:
up until then.


00:01:17:15 - 00:01:39:26
Leonard Feather or Oscar Peterson:
musically, to find record length commercially, I don't think it holds much value because the public is, up to that standard in music. Yeah, there's yet I believe it's Tristano and Konitz, isn't it? It sounds just like him. And, quickly, Konitz is one of my favorites. And Lenny, I think everything was executed, executed more than well on the record.


00:01:39:26 - 00:01:48:12
Leonard Feather or Oscar Peterson:
I think it definitely three that,


00:01:48:14 - 00:02:12:14
Leonard Feather or Oscar Peterson:
Sounded like. No, but, then I think them one is the very Joe tune when we. The group didn't sound too well coordinated, however, for the, for the opening of it and the part of the piano, of course, I'll give it two stars. I don't think it holds that much musical value. You know.


00:02:12:17 - 00:02:16:12
Leonard Feather or Oscar Peterson:
Wow.


00:02:16:14 - 00:02:34:19
Leonard Feather or Oscar Peterson:
That's horrible. Whoever it is, I don't know what. There's nothing there. So I have to say. No stars, no bells, nothing.


00:02:34:21 - 00:03:01:18
Leonard Feather or Oscar Peterson:
So I call that a good example of, how Art Tatum is ruined. So many piano players unconsciously, I, I didn't like that record at all. Ended the first course with two spasmodic. I think he was trying to, whoever wasn't trying to imitate Tatum to too much of a degree. The second chorus shows it was definitely that way, because more or less he settled down, or in his own, his own style, and without the Tatum ideas, he was lost.


00:03:01:20 - 00:03:05:03
Leonard Feather or Oscar Peterson:
I'd give it one and a half stars and.


00:03:07:21 - 00:03:30:10
Leonard Feather or Oscar Peterson:
Harpsichord. Couldn't have done it very well. I like the record person. I don't know who it could be. whoever it is has a wonderful technique. for the tune, I think is more or less worn out. It's been done so many times, but, on the whole, I like the record. I give it two and a half stars, one for technically, I think it's a good record.


00:03:30:10 - 00:03:46:23
Leonard Feather or Oscar Peterson:
I don't think that, whoever it is was playing. Yes, but actually had a chance to, express all of his ideas on the disc. I think to the two of the record, you can find smatterings of of the talent. A lot of talent. Yeah.


00:03:55:04 - 00:04:15:19
Leonard Feather or Oscar Peterson:
Commercial. I think it's a good record. One thing that, I always do by my own personal records is even if there's a record with just four buyers that I like, I buy it, you know, and I think that first chorus was actually too delicate for the tenor. So the polished, the vocal and the vocal mechanic or the piano course.


00:04:15:19 - 00:04:32:15
Leonard Feather or Oscar Peterson:
Yes. But, on the whole, I like the record tenor solo fitted the type of vocal that was done. I give it three stars and I don't know, no idea.


00:04:32:17 - 00:04:57:21
Leonard Feather or Oscar Peterson:
I'm unfamiliar with, Dixieland because of the type of music I don't necessarily dislike, but I don't. It doesn't intrigue me that much. And, not being a judge or classifying myself as a jazz, Dixieland kind of guy, just give it two and a half stars for it. And insofar as listening value and from what I've heard of Dixieland, I'd say would be good Dixieland.


00:04:58:05 - 00:05:01:15
Leonard Feather or Oscar Peterson:
you know, anything, regardless of what type of music there is, you know.


00:05:02:03 - 00:05:25:01
Leonard Feather or Oscar Peterson:
Whatever music you listen to, there is such a thing as good and bad. And I would classify it a good Dixieland, although I don't particularly go for that particular style. I like the trumpet very much. I think of the two and a half instead, just on the trumpet, some up and coming other down. No more common. Okay.


00:05:25:03 - 00:05:42:24
Leonard Feather or Oscar Peterson:
Well, before we go any further, you can give this one for stars because, and if you don't mind, I'll just I'll remark remarks. I have to, to make about this record of the piano solo, even though I know that the Benny Goodman group and the record on the whole is fine, but the piano solo, I think, is more than outstanding.


00:05:42:24 - 00:06:04:00
Leonard Feather or Oscar Peterson:
In fact, I've never heard Teddy turn out a bad record as yet. It is terrible. For less than five minutes. the, the, I don't want to say the clean technique, the taste, the touch. There's nothing you can say wrong about the piano because, yeah, of course, because Teddy is more or less, to me, a genius.


00:06:04:02 - 00:06:26:19
Leonard Feather or Oscar Peterson:
And, along with the piano solo, the the, planet solo by many movement. I think it's one of his more subtle things. I've heard him swing a little more, but on the whole, I think, the group was wonderful. And that vibes, it went over, I believe. I don't think you played very well there, but however the, the, other solos went on the record more or less made up for whatever happened.


00:06:26:19 - 00:06:44:21
Leonard Feather or Oscar Peterson:
The. Next.


00:06:44:23 - 00:07:11:06
Leonard Feather or Oscar Peterson:
Well, it sounds like do the piano solo, from what I heard, didn't exactly resemble the style. I would say it has possibly. Could be Billy Strayhorn, but, on the whole, in in parts, it doesn't sound like the only band, but there's enough there. For instance, I think it's Lawrence Brown on trombone. The record on the whole impressed me this way, but, it's a very weak Ellington thing.


00:07:11:08 - 00:07:34:14
Leonard Feather or Oscar Peterson:
I mean, I've heard better, in my opinion, other better things by Duke and, better composition. Yes, I have that. There definitely. I would say this is one of his weaker and it's. On the whole, I think it lacks the usual Ellington continuity. You know, the parts that just don't sound like Ellington. if it is the.


00:07:34:17 - 00:07:52:07
Leonard Feather or Oscar Peterson:
Yeah. And the trombone solo is outstanding. I like the piano solo. I would say, Billy, stay on the piano. Doesn't sound like this. I'd give it, three stars.


00:07:54:18 - 00:07:56:03
Leonard Feather or Oscar Peterson:
you like that kind of music?


00:07:56:12 - 00:08:21:26
Lester Young:
do. President. I mean, it's kind of over my head, you know, over your head or under? Over wherever. My head. But it's nice, and I can. But I can get at that rhythm that goes back the number of. Yeah, that's the only thing. Other than that, I could make it, you know, if it was straight with. Yeah, something like that.


00:08:22:00 - 00:08:24:15
Leonard Feather or Oscar Peterson:
But then again, I.


00:08:24:17 - 00:08:25:09
Lester Young:
Yeah.


00:08:25:12 - 00:08:26:18
Leonard Feather or Oscar Peterson:
I voted for.


00:08:27:02 - 00:08:44:00
Lester Young:
it on the weekends. I mean because then my number, you know, the way I would fare. Yeah, yeah.


00:08:44:03 - 00:08:45:27
Leonard Feather or Oscar Peterson:
What do you think of the group?


00:08:45:29 - 00:09:01:08
Lester Young:
I thought all of it was nice this other that, the rhythm that you're doing has been much better there, you know? Yeah. And they had that kind of rhythm, this straight line, you know, put it like that.


00:09:01:11 - 00:09:04:07
Unknown
That.


00:09:13:24 - 00:09:36:05
Lester Young:
yeah. That's real crazy. I like it. I think I heard it once in Chicago. yeah. You that I'm not, the only thing I would say would be Woody Herman and either Stan Kenton, you know, that's. But that's bad, you know, that? I know, and I know the name of the tenor player, but it's, it's crazy the way the arrangements and things.


00:09:36:16 - 00:09:48:27
Lester Young:
yeah, I think that's real great. yeah, I, I, I go like that. In fact, I'm, I get that that's a new track and with the record, you know. Okay. Yeah.


00:09:48:27 - 00:09:53:25
Leonard Feather or Oscar Peterson:
With that, are you surprised again?


00:09:53:27 - 00:09:56:12
Leonard Feather or Oscar Peterson:
Well, not.


00:09:56:14 - 00:10:14:18
Lester Young:
Yeah. Well, I mean, I'll go for that too, you know, I like it because we played in Chicago with, the Spanish. Yeah. And they was wailing with the Dixieland. I mean, and, you know, so people like things like that is real nice. So I think it's crazy.


00:10:14:18 - 00:10:16:12
Leonard Feather or Oscar Peterson:
Do you think it's done well here?


00:10:16:19 - 00:10:17:01
Lester Young:
Yeah.


00:10:17:06 - 00:10:19:01
Leonard Feather or Oscar Peterson:
Do you like that?


00:10:19:03 - 00:10:28:23
Lester Young:
What? Is that bad? It's, Yeah. Whoever it is. Yeah. I thought it was nice when they dropped it. Solo thing? Yeah, that is very nice to hear.


00:10:29:18 - 00:10:34:16
Leonard Feather or Oscar Peterson:
did you hear that that that was kind of playing a long time ago like that.


00:10:34:19 - 00:10:50:25
Lester Young:
That played them so. And all the time. It used to be bad news to play with Tommy Dorsey. Yeah. And something like that. And I used to him when I used to play those records and things like that. Yeah. Nobody never played like. And so I like a salad. Yeah. You know, so it was a style of his own.


00:10:50:27 - 00:11:13:24
Lester Young:
Yeah. Like that. It was like that. I think you could say nothing, but it's nice, you know how you hear that? And I think, on the kind of a Dixieland I think. I think three, That's nice. Right? Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I.


00:11:13:26 - 00:11:20:11
Lester Young:
Yeah.


00:11:20:14 - 00:11:31:10
Lester Young:
All the way. I think that's real nice. The Klan and I don't know, the band and nothing like that, but, I mean, it's beautiful music, you know, I like that.


00:11:31:12 - 00:11:32:17
Leonard Feather or Oscar Peterson:
That's really cool.


00:11:32:20 - 00:11:36:04
Lester Young:
Yeah, well, I don't know what it is, and I think it's so pretty.


00:11:36:06 - 00:11:39:25
Leonard Feather or Oscar Peterson:
That's right. You have any particular favorite composer?


00:11:39:27 - 00:12:01:28
Lester Young:
Nah, I never dig into that. Into the classical know? Yeah. You know, I wouldn't know what to say. And very few records I've heard, because I never done that deep, you know. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'd give them bovver. Whoever it is, I don't know, the band. And then it's, It's pretty. Come on, try to get the record.


00:12:01:28 - 00:12:03:11
Lester Young:
Did.


00:12:03:13 - 00:12:13:26
Unknown
Yeah. 3 to 2in our through that all the time.


00:12:13:27 - 00:12:20:15
Leonard Feather or Oscar Peterson:
And like Tommy Dorsey one, you know, the only one he discussed was a trumpet. I think you know that.


00:12:20:15 - 00:12:33:28
Lester Young:
One the trumpeter was playing on that, but, well, I don't think I would go like, just one and I'd say Al Killian. no, other than that, I put it,


00:12:34:00 - 00:12:38:17
Leonard Feather or Oscar Peterson:
Okay. yeah. What do you think? Oh, performance.


00:12:38:17 - 00:12:47:00
Lester Young:
Not good on the record. Oh, well, I have to, That's my people. You know, that, scientific method. Great.


00:12:47:00 - 00:12:51:24
Leonard Feather or Oscar Peterson:
The guys.


00:12:51:27 - 00:13:07:05
Leonard Feather or Oscar Peterson:
You like the, I don't know what I want to ask about it. What do you think about the general new school of tenor man? All these, young kids, like the four brothers and all, they the whole new school kind of can't buy you.


00:13:08:08 - 00:13:20:29
Lester Young:
everybody want to ask me that? When I tell you what, they just fascinate me, you know? Yeah, because I hear little things that I've played, you know? Yeah. And I just. That's me and things like that.


00:13:21:01 - 00:13:23:01
Leonard Feather or Oscar Peterson:
Do you like the way I kind of going down?


00:13:23:03 - 00:13:38:13
Lester Young:
Yeah. I mean, I always like that. Like that. You know what I mean? Because whenever I came to New York, you know, I got bruised because I didn't play like Coleman Hawkins. Yeah. So I used to do a lot of teardrops then, and then, but I mean, I say, well, you know, some people that I haven't, as I said, anything.


00:13:38:17 - 00:13:48:29
Lester Young:
Yeah. So just Lester, the way you feel. And I hear those people playing like that, I go and buy their records, do and things and sit up and listen and knock me out.


00:13:48:29 - 00:13:52:07
Leonard Feather or Oscar Peterson:
You know what I can tell about it? For the.


00:13:52:09 - 00:14:08:10
Lester Young:
Record. Yeah, well, just the ones I like the same way like you playing. If I hear one, I like it or something. Or they play one over the radio or something. I'll go and get it. something like that. I like to be like, more to, like, a variety, you know? I wouldn't like to get hung up with one thing, you know?


00:14:08:12 - 00:14:10:15
Lester Young:
So that's why I speak like that.


00:14:10:21 - 00:14:16:25
Leonard Feather or Oscar Peterson:
You know, I play quite a wide variety of things in your life. Oh, my God, that's right.


00:14:17:18 - 00:14:23:16
Lester Young:
just all music and all day and all night music and things, you know.


00:14:23:18 - 00:14:37:16
Leonard Feather or Oscar Peterson:
It's different that you have any any particular all by the record. When I think about record. Yeah. I mean, like, I think that you were one of the good. Well start there, you know, including your on it.


00:14:37:16 - 00:14:55:28
Lester Young:
You're like no, no on that myself. I don't never go like that one. Well I mean just you'd be surprised you have the record. The Alhambra, which was something like the stars fell ran in and something is jail and it's sound.


00:14:56:13 - 00:15:01:11
Leonard Feather or Oscar Peterson:
nothing like that. they did a good.


00:15:01:14 - 00:15:04:26
Lester Young:
It's a blues. Yeah. Have you heard that?


00:15:04:28 - 00:15:06:26
Leonard Feather or Oscar Peterson:
I'm not sure if I know that one.


00:15:06:28 - 00:15:25:06
Lester Young:
Yeah. Alhambra. Yeah. It's real crazy. So that's why I buy them. I get one and I don't, I just and get it then that way, you know, deliver. But if something like that storm is shining and something. And I sit here in my cell, hard. Dude, it.


00:15:25:08 - 00:15:27:07
Leonard Feather or Oscar Peterson:
Might be a new one. I like that they.


00:15:27:10 - 00:15:49:04
Lester Young:
Might have some kind of red label, whatever. They want it. Right? Yeah. So. Right. Pretty bad. I sing the blues. Well, it comes natural for him to sing the blues like that, because he used to go with that Jamaican band, and he used to say, and they would salad and, child or whatever. Then. Yardbird. Yeah. Oh, there they go.


00:15:49:04 - 00:16:05:10
Lester Young:
You know, the blues. Yeah, yeah. And the same thing is, you know, so, you know, you can sing the blues, but in thing in history, things like that, you know, which is nice. You have a lovely voice, I guess you hear the blues, but.


00:16:05:13 - 00:16:07:03
Leonard Feather or Oscar Peterson:
You're walking in a dark world.


00:16:07:06 - 00:16:12:27
Lester Young:
You just started to get some very pretty tones, pretty tone.


00:16:12:29 - 00:16:17:18
Leonard Feather or Oscar Peterson:
What about that? Was that about bands then?


00:16:17:22 - 00:16:20:02
Leonard Feather or Oscar Peterson:
Yeah.


00:16:20:04 - 00:16:21:11
Leonard Feather or Oscar Peterson:
Well.


00:16:21:14 - 00:16:29:25
Lester Young:
You know, they broke my heart back and they love it. But if I would go, I would go with the Hammond. Right? Yeah. You sound just like.


00:16:29:27 - 00:16:33:29
Leonard Feather or Oscar Peterson:
Great things like that. So they do that.


00:16:34:01 - 00:16:51:24
Lester Young:
That's the way I would go for big band that kind of. They say, you know, it's small band. We play so much of that. Oh, is that it? I haven't heard him, but right on Woody Herman. If you keep jumping like that, that's me all the time.


00:16:51:26 - 00:17:00:02
Leonard Feather or Oscar Peterson:
Oh that's great. Okay, we got a good interview there, I love that you form big band of your own.


00:17:00:05 - 00:17:18:19
Lester Young:
Oh, I would love to, but the. I wouldn't go for the open though. Band headache. Yeah. And then evil spirit in there. Yeah, that's too much drag. I can barely make it with five. Like, I'm playing the, you know, like that old lady told me.


00:17:18:19 - 00:17:21:19
Leonard Feather or Oscar Peterson:
There's always a bass in a band. Yeah.


00:17:21:21 - 00:17:40:23
Lester Young:
You know what I mean. You never know who it is today. If it's in five, they can get it in a trio. They can get it. They did what? I mean, but to do it like you and me. Gig him and. And it'll be like, there's two of us. That's one. And one is 11. What? But you do it cool.


00:17:40:23 - 00:18:03:19
Lester Young:
Apparently, that Eminem is that it? Did it. They. Nah. Then it got away and then they come three and we go, oh, that one lonely one. That's pretty neat. Do you think he's tight with. He did say why don't we get four now. Another one. What we know we tried from the beginning. Right. So now they're good tight so nice to into.


00:18:03:19 - 00:18:16:26
Lester Young:
It's 22. You know I like that. But you get two and you get five. Then they'll get him and everything and leave me. Then I become one out of five, like I said, right.


00:18:16:28 - 00:18:17:21
Leonard Feather or Oscar Peterson:
Yeah.


00:18:17:23 - 00:18:37:20
Lester Young:
This is like, yeah. Oh okay. Then I'm the one let go. You do? Yeah. But I started out with one and one day they had it build up upon me like one pin cut. Yeah, right. The two don't go there, but the next one, the other man would come and go in it and buy it. That's two with you.


00:18:37:23 - 00:18:49:18
Lester Young:
But do they take him down? Right. Then you get another one with the starter. Yeah, one I know I did it, two did that. I like it.


00:18:49:18 - 00:19:10:25
Leonard Feather or Oscar Peterson:
Think of it, you know, at less than one language and you know and the rule talking to me, you very rarely talk like you talk to your friend. We need to talk communicate with in our language, in English, you know? But, otherwise we get to talk, and we. You can make one word, people, with, you know, like I everybody talking about.


00:19:10:25 - 00:19:12:29
Lester Young:
Cool that we're.


00:19:13:01 - 00:19:31:19
Leonard Feather or Oscar Peterson:
Here for sure. I mean, there's a lot that hasn't been written about listening to. Couldn't it? I mean, the guy is really, really contributing his way. I want to get a lot more, really contributed. No. I've been I know that the most in every frame around here. How long you.


00:19:31:19 - 00:19:31:27
Lester Young:
Talk.


00:19:32:01 - 00:19:37:00
Leonard Feather or Oscar Peterson:
About how much you think? I mean, when you say you don't want to do something. I don't care how you think.


00:19:37:03 - 00:19:38:10
Lester Young:
The minute back and what he said.


00:19:38:10 - 00:19:43:10
Leonard Feather or Oscar Peterson:
No, I that that just wraps up everything, you know, everything.


00:19:43:13 - 00:19:47:04
Lester Young:
You just can't say it. That's all you're.


00:19:47:07 - 00:19:50:13
Leonard Feather or Oscar Peterson:
Ever going to hear.


00:19:51:00 - 00:19:56:16
Lester Young:
and when I say it with that, I don't know the Frank, you know, I have to go.


00:19:56:19 - 00:20:01:18
Leonard Feather or Oscar Peterson:
And I'm a, like, a big man or. I mean, you have a kind of a life.


00:20:01:21 - 00:20:06:02
Lester Young:
That's why I want it to be real nice when I do go. Yeah, but in America.


00:20:06:02 - 00:20:28:21
Leonard Feather or Oscar Peterson:
Now, a good day, Frank. I don't know what they're Frank. That's on the streets. And what am. I really the best thing when you're on the field with your family? Or is it? yeah. A little work or what goes around.


00:20:28:24 - 00:20:55:10
